Financially constrained firms are identified using a number of criteria, including the criterion suggested by Bond and Meghir (1994) based on the firm\u2019s financial policy. The main finding is that the effect of cash flow on inventory investment is concentrated among firms identified as financially constrained using either their financial policy or a criterion based on their current ratio. This suggests that there is no unique criterion for identifying financially constrained firms using financial information in company accounts. Contrary to what previous studies have found, using firm size or the coverage ratio to define financially constrained firms does not reduce the effect of cash flow on the inventory investment of unconstrained firms. This raises doubts about whether these are accurate indicators of whether a firm is financially constrained. Combined with Bond and Meghir\u2019s similar findings for fixed investment, the results in this paper suggest that cash flow effects form part of the monetary transmission mechanism.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2000/inventory-investment-and-cash-flow.pdf?la=en&hash=1CA95A264093BF66F97C57857542456006BA70EC", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2000/inventory-investment-and-cash-flow.pdf?la=en&hash=1CA95A264093BF66F97C57857542456006BA70EC"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2000/inventory-investment-and-cash-flow.pdf?la=en&hash=1CA95A264093BF66F97C57857542456006BA70EC", "path": "full/01218f61eb7cc857b07cc7925b83ea81c35d8765", "checksum": "855a640bdc9c577dd72fc6bd9e2ca7ab", "status": "uptodate"}]},

In the customer market model, firms lower their mark-up when current output is low relative to future profits, foregoing current profits in order to capture future market share. In markets characterised by implicit collusion, firms lower their mark-up when current output is high relative to future profits in order to lower the incentives to undercut the implicit cartel. We characterise the dynamics by analysing the response of the mark-up, employment and output to shocks to demand (identified by innovations in government expenditure), TFP growth, and to prices of imported materials. Though the two mark-up models have quantitatively similar properties in terms of the dynamics of output and employment, they differ qualitatively - the implicit collusion model increases the output response to shocks to government expenditure and to the price of imported materials, while the customer market model dampens fluctuations in response to these shocks. Only the customer market model generates mark-up dynamics that conform with the empirical evidence on mark-up pricing in the United Kingdom, such as Small (1997), that finds procyclical mark-ups at the sectoral level, and with the priors embedded in typical macroeconometric models, such as the one used at Bank of England. The empirical evidence is at odds with the evidence for the United States and our theoretical investigation suggests that at a macroeconomic level, the only way to reconcile these two facts is to assume different models of pricing behaviour.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2000/imperfect-competition-and-the-dynamics-of-mark-ups.pdf?la=en&hash=80D549C038632D81E963745E73802113EAA80611", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2000/imperfect-competition-and-the-dynamics-of-mark-ups.pdf?la=en&hash=80D549C038632D81E963745E73802113EAA80611"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2000/imperfect-competition-and-the-dynamics-of-mark-ups.pdf?la=en&hash=80D549C038632D81E963745E73802113EAA80611", "path": "full/1690f5479597507929d6c1902f17b5d224ce4db7", "checksum": "6776a0188b2abd72a5b3ef409c35736a", "status": "uptodate"}]},

However, subject to this caveat, we find that it can reproduce the stylised fact that there is little relationship between monetary aggregates and either output or inflation, even though the underlying cause of inflation is money growth. We also find that the money-income and money-inflation relationships vary substantially depending on what type of shock is hitting the economy.

We model a small system of eight variables that theoretically have an important role in the transmission mechanism. The aim is to decompose the movements of each of these variables into a small number of independent underlying forcing processes or \u2018shocks\u2019, with a well-defined economic interpretation. To do this we estimate a statistical (VAR) model of the data, on which we impose a minimal number of identifying restrictions. Cointegration analysis is also used to distinguish between permanent shocks, which drive the stochastic trends of the system, and temporary shocks, which have purely cyclical effects. We find that, in addition to identifying shocks to productivity, domestic demand, external demand and the foreign exchange risk premium, we are able to distinguish between several types of monetary shock. In particular, we are able to make a distinction between \u2018permanent\u2019 monetary policy shocks, attributable to changes in the underlying nominal target of the authorities, and \u2018temporary\u2019 policy shocks, reflecting either policy \u2018errors\u2019 or transitory deviations from the authorities\u2019 reaction function. We are also able to identify a financial intermediation shock, reflecting changes in the provision of credit by the banking system and the degree of financial liberalisation. We demonstrate some of the practical uses to which the model can be put. These include: (a) estimating the deviation of each of the variables from long-run equilibrium to generate measures of the output gap and the size of liquidity under/overhangs; (b) analysing the importance of different shocks for each of the variables over different periods in UK economic history; and (c) generating conditional inflation forecasts based on different paths for the stochastic trends and monetary policy.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2000/a-small-structural-empirical-model-of-the-uk-monetary-transmission-mechanism.pdf?la=en&hash=2A8EB64E98A1ABACE343A51495E8D65DB4083722", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2000/a-small-structural-empirical-model-of-the-uk-monetary-transmission-mechanism.pdf?la=en&hash=2A8EB64E98A1ABACE343A51495E8D65DB4083722"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2000/a-small-structural-empirical-model-of-the-uk-monetary-transmission-mechanism.pdf?la=en&hash=2A8EB64E98A1ABACE343A51495E8D65DB4083722", "path": "full/db6d5b521cdb976e2cdc10b948656c94ec19ca2f", "checksum": "6c8ac1f667b9d727bf1472f5f7c4f737", "status": "uptodate"}]},

First, we look at some simple models of\u00a0monetary decision-making in a monetary union and ask how much more\u00a0variable a country\u2019s output and inflation is likely to be if it joins the\u00a0union. We answer this analytically and then go on to \u2018calibrate\u2019 the\u00a0simple model. The model has few structural equations, but it is useful in\u00a0allowing us to examine how the variability of output and inflation are\u00a0likely to change as key parameters change. Our conclusions, in this\u00a0respect, are likely to be sensitive to model specification. However, we\u00a0also identify a second-best issue concerning the optimal make-up of the\u00a0monetary union which is likely to be more robust: namely that only\u00a0when all members of the union have the same structural parameter\u00a0values (and shocks are perfectly correlated) will it be optimal for a new\u00a0member to have these same structural parameter values.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/1999/monetary-stabilisation-policy-in-a-monetary-union.pdf?la=en&hash=FAAED08DD1F19BFFEF496EEDD791415096EB811B", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/1999/monetary-stabilisation-policy-in-a-monetary-union.pdf?la=en&hash=FAAED08DD1F19BFFEF496EEDD791415096EB811B"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/1999/monetary-stabilisation-policy-in-a-monetary-union.pdf?la=en&hash=FAAED08DD1F19BFFEF496EEDD791415096EB811B", "path": "full/e16881efca0fac4c042ea522d6592fadc4140bc9", "checksum": "03e6141c6b67fda80cbba7e05e269841", "status": "uptodate"}]},

We write down a model of news production and consumption in which news generation is endogenous because the central bank must draft its communication in such a way that newspapers choose to report it, while still retaining the message the central bank wishes to convey to the public. We use our model to show that standard econometric techniques that correlate central bank text with measures of news coverage in order to determine what causes central bank communication to be reported on will likely prove to be biased. We use techniques from computational linguistics combined with an event-study methodology to measure the extent of news coverage a central bank communication receives, and the textual features that might cause a communication to be more (or less) likely to be considered newsworthy. We consider the case of the Bank of England, and estimate the relationship between news coverage and central bank communication implied by our model. We find that the interaction between the state of the economy and the way in which the Bank of England writes its communication is important for determining news coverage. We provide concrete suggestions for ways in which central bank communication can increase its news coverage by improving readability in line with our results.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2021/the-transmission-of-central-bank-communication-to-the-general-public-via-the-print-media.pdf?la=en&hash=42B43371D16257F93862BF45D092E758179AD31D", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2021/the-transmission-of-central-bank-communication-to-the-general-public-via-the-print-media.pdf?la=en&hash=42B43371D16257F93862BF45D092E758179AD31D"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2021/the-transmission-of-central-bank-communication-to-the-general-public-via-the-print-media.pdf?la=en&hash=42B43371D16257F93862BF45D092E758179AD31D", "path": "full/3221b7fdbd50b54a617cafcd801412a674c76f70", "checksum": "00cfe8e3bc6adb908338385c3bdbafe4", "status": "uptodate"}]},

As interbank networks become more connected and more regular in structure, the contagion risk of system-wide shocks and individual bank defaults initially increases and then decreases, all else being equal. The low density heterogeneous network structures that typify real interbank networks are particularly prone to solvency distress contagion risk, when banks are similar in balance sheet size and capitalisation. However, when networks are calibrated to UK data, the higher capitalisation of large, highly-connected banks relative to their interbank exposures significantly increases the resilience of the system and reduces the importance of network structure. These findings reinforce the importance and effectiveness of imposing higher capital buffers on systemically important banks and of policies that limit interbank exposures. We also demonstrate that for real-world interbank networks, simple network metrics other than individual bank connectedness do not provide robust indicators for monitoring solvency contagion risk, suggesting that policymakers should continue efforts to model these risks explicitly rather than rely on simple aggregate indicators.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2021/solvency-distress-contagion-risk-network-structure-bank-heterogeneity-and-systemic-resilience.pdf?la=en&hash=9094886A83BF70FE222EAC3D6BE95659D6AAFA5E", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2021/solvency-distress-contagion-risk-network-structure-bank-heterogeneity-and-systemic-resilience.pdf?la=en&hash=9094886A83BF70FE222EAC3D6BE95659D6AAFA5E"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2021/solvency-distress-contagion-risk-network-structure-bank-heterogeneity-and-systemic-resilience.pdf?la=en&hash=9094886A83BF70FE222EAC3D6BE95659D6AAFA5E", "path": "full/436d78caac89f8847f324083fc3f41decd778929", "checksum": "c689a0023f7e745ff27ba613cf42cab7", "status": "uptodate"}]},

For this reason, monetary authorities should not just aim at stabilising inflation and the output gap but also mitigate the volatility of their balance sheet. In response to negative demand shocks at the zero lower bound (ZLB), the optimal monetary policy consists of a mix of forward guidance and mild adjustments in the balance sheet. The presence of balance-sheet policies reduces the optimal ZLB duration and significantly improves social welfare. Mitigating the effectiveness of forward guidance calls for a more substantial balance-sheet expansion and a shorter ZLB duration. If a central bank only aims to stabilise inflation and the output gap, welfare losses are significantly larger than under the optimal policy and balance-sheet policies only improve welfare if the weight on output-gap stabilisation is relatively large. Last, simple implementable policy rules can achieve welfare outcomes close to those under the optimal policy.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2021/optimal-monetary-policy-mix-at-the-zero-lower-bound.pdf?la=en&hash=FF55E009CC5DF63EFC970717450B9FB6F40ECB78", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2021/optimal-monetary-policy-mix-at-the-zero-lower-bound.pdf?la=en&hash=FF55E009CC5DF63EFC970717450B9FB6F40ECB78"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2021/optimal-monetary-policy-mix-at-the-zero-lower-bound.pdf?la=en&hash=FF55E009CC5DF63EFC970717450B9FB6F40ECB78", "path": "full/b7985942afdb4cf36fff6566646a1f228a19f58f", "checksum": "13cc5d2f491b8b4c4f793d05d1f874cd", "status": "uptodate"}]},

Using the universe of mortgages originated in the UK, we show that lenders seek to segment the market by offering two-part tariffs composed of interest rates and origination fees, and that during recent periods of unconventional monetary policy, such as UK\u2019s Funding for Lending Scheme, lenders decreased interest rates and increased origination fees. To understand lenders\u2019 pricing strategies and their effects on market equilibrium, we develop and estimate a structural discrete-continuous model of mortgage demand and lender competition in which borrowers may have different sensitivities to rates and fees. We use the estimated model to decompose the effects of central bank unconventional monetary policy on mortgage pricing and lending, finding that central bank operations increased borrower surplus and lender profits. Moreover, although origination fees allow lender to price discriminate and capture surplus, banning fees would lower borrower surplus and aggregate welfare.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2021/mortgage-pricing-and-monetary-policy", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2021/mortgage-pricing-and-monetary-policy"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2021/mortgage-pricing-and-monetary-policy", "path": "full/575eb5622061adca46d0621711775bd6288b1dd8", "checksum": "b2ed62d70249dd1a0fad8e2ce18c679f", "status": "uptodate"}]},

We provide empirical evidence that in response to unexpected increases in the Federal Funds rate associated with Fed information shocks, the dollar depreciates instead of appreciating. We show that this phenomenon occurs because Fed announcements affect investors\u2019 risk appetite. Expansionary Fed information shocks increase investors\u2019 risk appetite and drive capital towards foreign markets in pursuit of higher yields. Conversely, contractionary Fed information shocks decrease investors\u2019 risk appetite and drive capital towards safe-haven currencies, causing an appreciation of the dollar and safe-haven currencies vis-\u00e0-vis foreign currencies. We provide evidence that the Fed information effect is associated with large spillovers onto global safe-haven currencies, risk premia, cross-border credit, and ultimately, on global economic activity. These findings highlight the presence of global spillovers of the Fed information effect.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2021/global-spillovers-of-the-fed-information-effect.pdf?la=en&hash=C8ACD708C165776808CDCF7BCCF0248361AAFF5B", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2021/global-spillovers-of-the-fed-information-effect.pdf?la=en&hash=C8ACD708C165776808CDCF7BCCF0248361AAFF5B"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2021/global-spillovers-of-the-fed-information-effect.pdf?la=en&hash=C8ACD708C165776808CDCF7BCCF0248361AAFF5B", "path": "full/c44546490d9adffc7339faea7fd52abec82fee2d", "checksum": "a9c50624d53db05c121a66c1388a0360", "status": "uptodate"}]},

To this end, we extract a common factor from the realised volatilities of about\u00a01,000 risky asset returns from around the world. We then study how shocks to the factor affect economic activity in 44 advanced and emerging small open economies by estimating local projections in a panel regression framework. We find that the output responses are quite heterogeneous across countries but,\u00a0in general, negative and persistent. Furthermore, the effects of shocks to the global factor are stronger in countries with a higher degree of trade and/or financial openness, as well as in countries with a higher level of vulnerabilities.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2020/the-global-effects-of-global-risk-and-uncertainty.pdf?la=en&hash=3B428FD00EB965AF4AEC2551469AD10D98A2A720", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2020/the-global-effects-of-global-risk-and-uncertainty.pdf?la=en&hash=3B428FD00EB965AF4AEC2551469AD10D98A2A720"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2020/the-global-effects-of-global-risk-and-uncertainty.pdf?la=en&hash=3B428FD00EB965AF4AEC2551469AD10D98A2A720", "path": "full/c267cef019051bb598a60c78bf632316519d3c5d", "checksum": "e0eba78d5ec57c522eaf57d3002d8fbf", "status": "uptodate"}]},

This provides a novel approach for estimating the possible relative cost of conventional and GDP-linked bonds, which is likely to be of interest to sovereigns considering the case for issuing GDP-linked debt. Our model predicts that US GDP-linked bonds would typically have yields lower than those on conventional Treasury bonds with the same maturity in our sample from 2010 to 2017. Positive expected future GDP growth lowers the yield on GDP-linked bonds relative to conventional bonds, which typically more than offsets the estimated GDP risk premium demanded by investors for holding GDP risk. These risk premia decrease with maturity, with unconditional averages falling in absolute value from 7 percentage points at the short-end of the curve to 1 percentage points at the 10-year horizon.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2020/no-arbitrage-pricing-of-gdp-linked-bonds.pdf?la=en&hash=43545E881B84DEA5849C1AE26921B8AA985429E7", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2020/no-arbitrage-pricing-of-gdp-linked-bonds.pdf?la=en&hash=43545E881B84DEA5849C1AE26921B8AA985429E7"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2020/no-arbitrage-pricing-of-gdp-linked-bonds.pdf?la=en&hash=43545E881B84DEA5849C1AE26921B8AA985429E7", "path": "full/54bdb607041992416952621f97e94397b32665ab", "checksum": "a928164f8d3e9b6390c389fa7abfd607", "status": "uptodate"}]},

Technology diffuses slowly and affects total factor productivity in an S-shaped pattern. Responsible for about a tenth of economic fluctuations at business cycle frequencies, the shock elicits a slow, large and positive response of quantities, and a sluggish contraction of prices followed by an endogenous easing of the monetary stance. The ensuing economic expansion substantially anticipates any material increase in TFP.

{"pubdate": "\r\n    Published on  \r\n        26 April 2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n", "abstract": "\nIt is well known that quantitative credit restrictions, rather than Bagehot-style \u2018free lending\u2019 constituted the standard response to financial crises in the early days of central banking. But why did central banks in the past frequently restrict the supply of loans during financial crises? In this paper, we draw on a large novel, loan-level data set to study the Bank of England\u2019s policy response to the crisis of 1847. We find that credit rationing due to residual imperfect information in the sense of Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) cannot be a convincing explanation for quantitative credit restrictions during the crisis of 1847. We provide preliminary evidence which could suggest that discriminatory credit rationing on the basis of loan applicants\u2019 type and identity characterized the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE\u2019s) response to the crisis of 1847. Our results also show that collateral characteristics played an important role in the BoE\u2019s loan decisions, even after controlling for the identity of loan applicants. This finding confirms the hypothesis in Capie (2002) and Flandreau and Ugolini (2011, 2013, 2014) that the characteristics of bills of exchange submitted to the discount window mattered. Since our results suggest that the Bank also took decisions on the basis of the identity of loan applicants, our preliminary findings would seem to challenge Capie\u2019s \u2018frosted glass\u2019 metaphor, but more work is required to confirm these conjectures.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/the-bank-of-england-and-central-bank-credit-rationing-during-the-crisis-of-1847.pdf?la=en&hash=0368338BE5E1FCC33FDC29AFDB3E5F40CEFC3059", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/the-bank-of-england-and-central-bank-credit-rationing-during-the-crisis-of-1847.pdf?la=en&hash=0368338BE5E1FCC33FDC29AFDB3E5F40CEFC3059"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/the-bank-of-england-and-central-bank-credit-rationing-during-the-crisis-of-1847.pdf?la=en&hash=0368338BE5E1FCC33FDC29AFDB3E5F40CEFC3059", "path": "full/03d4dc81b2b0028fe2bd3f7ea3518792abb5b2a6", "checksum": "50c1e904e48a4e2cff8232b4165f2e35", "status": "uptodate"}]},

We calibrate the model to the UK banking system, and find that banks\u2019 optimal liquidation strategies translate into moderate fire-sale losses even for extremely large solvency shocks. By contrast, severe funding shocks can generate significant losses. Thus models focusing exclusively on solvency risk may significantly underestimate the extent of contagion via fire sales.

Consistent with the existing literature, we show that the direction of the wealth transfer at the conversion of CoCo bonds determines their impact on shareholder risk-taking incentives. We also find that \u2018anytime\u2019 CoCos (CoCo bonds trigger-able anytime at the discretion of managers) have a minor advantage over regular CoCo bonds, and that quality of capital requirements can reduce the risk-taking incentives of shareholders. We argue that shareholders can also use manager-specific CoCo bonds to reduce the riskiness of the bank activities. The issuance of such bonds can increase the resilience of individual banks and the whole banking system. Regulators can use restrictions on conversion rates and/or requirements on the quality of capital to address the impact of CoCo bonds issuance on risk-taking incentives.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/shareholder-risk-taking-incentives-in-the-presence-of-contingent-capital.pdf?la=en&hash=A1217CCD3BFA68C129086B742E8CF106CC8CAE5D", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/shareholder-risk-taking-incentives-in-the-presence-of-contingent-capital.pdf?la=en&hash=A1217CCD3BFA68C129086B742E8CF106CC8CAE5D"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/shareholder-risk-taking-incentives-in-the-presence-of-contingent-capital.pdf?la=en&hash=A1217CCD3BFA68C129086B742E8CF106CC8CAE5D", "path": "full/a34618e9ccdeed75ab5a14ee5fb83ff2da101025", "checksum": "82b3e50f25a3a3abc4ef136797c0674c", "status": "uptodate"}]},

We incorporate two features into a simple sticky-price model to generalize these results. First, that money may earn a strictly positive rate of return, motivated by recent debates on the introduction of central bank digital currencies and the introduction of interest-bearing reserves. This allows money-financed transfers to be used as a policy instrument at the effective lower bound, without giving up the ability to use the short-term bond rate to stabilize the economy in normal times. Second, a simple financial friction generates a wealth effect on household spending from government liabilities. Though temporary money-financed transfers to households can stimulate spending and inflation when the short-term bond rate is constrained by a lower bound, similar effects could be achieved by bond-financed tax cuts. So our results do not provide compelling reasons to choose monetary financing rather than bond financing.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/monetary-financing-with-interest-bearing-money.pdf?la=en&hash=7DC480A5954775C6006A657B4B78EBD7DE6E4246", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/monetary-financing-with-interest-bearing-money.pdf?la=en&hash=7DC480A5954775C6006A657B4B78EBD7DE6E4246"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/monetary-financing-with-interest-bearing-money.pdf?la=en&hash=7DC480A5954775C6006A657B4B78EBD7DE6E4246", "path": "full/db233ab366fe3585dfc2b89c594fe6d6569d68c1", "checksum": "a1dcdcc30dbebb38b7fd49c6e6896832", "status": "uptodate"}]},

Looking back at 120 years of data, we find that financial cycles exhibit behaviour characterised by recurrent, endogenous swings in financial conditions, which result in costly booms and busts. Yet the recurrent nature of such swings may not appear so obvious when looking at conventionally plotted time-series data (that is, observed in calendar time). Using the pioneering framework developed by Stock (1987), we offer a new statistical characterisation of the financial cycle using a continuous-time autoregressive model subject to time deformation (ie the difference between the time scale relevant for economic decision-making and conventional calendar time such as months, quarters and years), and test for systematic differences between calendar and a new notion of financial cycle time. We find the time deformation to be statistically significant, and associated with levels of long-term real interest rates, inflation volatility and the perceived riskiness of the macro-financial environment. Implications for statistical modelling, endogenous risk-taking economic behaviour and policy are highlighted.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/measuring-financial-cycle-time.pdf?la=en&hash=4BEE441D947969A6C8C784F9F4B30E31874290E0", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/measuring-financial-cycle-time.pdf?la=en&hash=4BEE441D947969A6C8C784F9F4B30E31874290E0"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/measuring-financial-cycle-time.pdf?la=en&hash=4BEE441D947969A6C8C784F9F4B30E31874290E0", "path": "full/3d8a1c72ff2d249fd163c68d581641255db33480", "checksum": "e19da302eec77c394b18a183a911cf04", "status": "uptodate"}]},

Default risk can be quantified as market-implied expected losses calculated from integrating equity market and balance sheet information in a structural default risk model. The expected losses of multiple banks and their non-parametric dependence structure define a multivariate distribution that generates portfolio-based estimates of the joint default risk using the aggregation technique of the Systemic CCA framework (Jobst and Gray, 2013). This market-implied valuation approach ('shadow capital adequacy') endogenises bank solvency as a probabilistic concept based on the perceived default risk (in contrast to accounting-based prudential measures of capital adequacy). The presented model adds to the literature of analytical tools for estimating market-implied systemic risk by augmenting the CCA approach with a jump diffusion process of asset changes to inform a more comprehensive and flexible assessment of common vulnerabilities to tail risks of the four largest UK commercial banks.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/market-implied-systemic-risk-and-shadow-capital-adequacy.pdf?la=en&hash=85C2374F0B448D1BF993F73EC5E81B740C13DFB3", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/market-implied-systemic-risk-and-shadow-capital-adequacy.pdf?la=en&hash=85C2374F0B448D1BF993F73EC5E81B740C13DFB3"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/market-implied-systemic-risk-and-shadow-capital-adequacy.pdf?la=en&hash=85C2374F0B448D1BF993F73EC5E81B740C13DFB3", "path": "full/8c60225bdc258f471bd288f4eaccc4ce81268199", "checksum": "56153f5750e9edb32fe425122488630d", "status": "uptodate"}]},

In our New Keynesian DSGE model with search and matching frictions, migration flows are driven by fluctuations in the relative labor market performance across the monetary union. The optimizing monetary policymaker shows greater flexibility in inflation targeting when labor is mobile by leaning somewhat against deviations of migration flows from efficient benchmarks. But strict inflation targeting remains close to optimal. For a given monetary policy, labor mobility facilitates macroeconomic adjustments by reducing efficiency gaps in regional labor markets. Internal migration therefore reduces the welfare costs of following simple suboptimal monetary policy rules in a monetary union.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/labor-mobility-in-a-monetary-union.pdf?la=en&hash=28ADC4B57C3958744CA39A9993889DF93DC0493E", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/labor-mobility-in-a-monetary-union.pdf?la=en&hash=28ADC4B57C3958744CA39A9993889DF93DC0493E"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/labor-mobility-in-a-monetary-union.pdf?la=en&hash=28ADC4B57C3958744CA39A9993889DF93DC0493E", "path": "full/aef13e90e659388d9ab4d455a3d2b561a73f369b", "checksum": "e139b9ff63885ee167c720e1925add28", "status": "uptodate"}]},

This paper studies an important\u00a0exception, a UK government scheme which in the five years since its inception has provided almost\u00a0\u00a310 billion of equity financing. The analysis of the origination and prepayment behavior of households who\u00a0have used the scheme highlights housing affordability constraints. A difference-in-difference analysis of an increase in the maximum government equity limit shows that households took advantage of the increase\u00a0to buy more expensive properties, and not to reduce their mortgage debt and house price risk exposure.\u00a0A counterfactual study of homebuyers who, instead of using the equity available, relied on high\u00a0loan-to-value mortgages shows that their financing choices can be rationalized by an expected rate of\u00a0house price appreciation of 7.7% per year. We draw general implications for how households approach\u00a0their house purchase and financing decisions, taking advantage of the fact that the shared equity\u00a0mortgages that we study allow the separation of the consumption and investment dimensions of housing.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/housing-consumption-and-investment-evidence-from-shared-equity-mortgages.pdf?la=en&hash=BE800AE99385407D18F5CC16337FF867E975378D", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/housing-consumption-and-investment-evidence-from-shared-equity-mortgages.pdf?la=en&hash=BE800AE99385407D18F5CC16337FF867E975378D"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/housing-consumption-and-investment-evidence-from-shared-equity-mortgages.pdf?la=en&hash=BE800AE99385407D18F5CC16337FF867E975378D", "path": "full/b5af73773b8b6de7924e681254b1ebf431671dce", "checksum": "b77c6b8b8447f9bab10721df63c56f09", "status": "uptodate"}]},

Using a unique sample, we document several facts about German small and medium enterprises (SMEs). First, bundling is a relatively rare activity, which is unevenly spread across sectors. Second, SMEs that bundle products and services are more productive than those selling products and services separately. Third, these firms tend to be more internationally oriented. While most of the existing literature focuses on large firms, we contribute to the literature by uncovering a robust positive relation between product-service bundling and exporting in SMEs. Importantly, the competitiveness-enhancing effect of bundling goes beyond manufacturing, affecting non-manufacturing firms also.

The nature of this uncertainty is different from that of a typical uncertainty shock because of its length, breadth and political complexity. Consequently, a new firm-level survey, the Decision Maker Panel (DMP), was created to investigate this, finding three key results. First, Brexit was reported to be one of the top three sources of uncertainty for around 40% of UK businesses in the two years after the vote in June 2016 referendum. This proportion increased further in Autumn 2018. Hence, Brexit provided both a major and persistent uncertainty shock. Second, uncertainty has been higher in industries that are more dependent on trade with the EU and on EU migrant labour. Third, the uncertainties around Brexit have been primarily about the impact on businesses over the longer term rather than shorter term, including uncertainty about the timing of any transition arrangements and around the nature of Brexit.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/brexit-and-uncertainty-insights-from-the-decision-maker-panel.pdf?la=en&hash=29A36FBC73CE71760D28C1201A889AF050EFC2D0", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/brexit-and-uncertainty-insights-from-the-decision-maker-panel.pdf?la=en&hash=29A36FBC73CE71760D28C1201A889AF050EFC2D0"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2019/brexit-and-uncertainty-insights-from-the-decision-maker-panel.pdf?la=en&hash=29A36FBC73CE71760D28C1201A889AF050EFC2D0", "path": "full/7635c488fae63b944e3537183884c67b8c91bdb4", "checksum": "a192ad5c0c3158abcb9d45b04e00cbb2", "status": "uptodate"}]},

Our results suggest that pension funds are sensitive to shocks that change their funding ratios \u2014 that is, the ratio of pension assets to liabilities. Deteriorations in funding ratios encourage pension funds supported by financially weaker corporate sponsors to switch some equity holdings into bonds. This is because reduced funding ratios weigh on the perceived vulnerability of already weak corporate sponsors. But similar deteriorations in funding ratios encourage funds supported by financially stronger corporates to increase their equity holdings to benefit from their higher expected returns. In contrast, shocks that result in material improvements in funding ratios \u2014 for example, resulting from a large rise in interest rates \u2014 encourage all pension funds to increase their bond holdings to \u2018lock in\u2019 those improved positions.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2018/what-drives-uk-defined-benefit-pension-funds-investment-behaviour.pdf?la=en&hash=8B057F358850A24CB8D8ED94EEC67867EC42C2F3", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2018/what-drives-uk-defined-benefit-pension-funds-investment-behaviour.pdf?la=en&hash=8B057F358850A24CB8D8ED94EEC67867EC42C2F3"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2018/what-drives-uk-defined-benefit-pension-funds-investment-behaviour.pdf?la=en&hash=8B057F358850A24CB8D8ED94EEC67867EC42C2F3", "path": "full/1c5043335fe7d562b9db93f0bd8e631c66ac775b", "checksum": "a211678bd7dc652d5c486978610d4a41", "status": "uptodate"}]},

Support for modifying the law to make limited\u00a0liability more easily available to banks was lower than for enterprises in general. Banks were seen as a\u00a0special case because of the risk of bank runs and because their creditors were not able to assess accurately\u00a0the riskiness of banks.

To show how aggregate labour market data hide important heterogeneity, we map the naturally occurring vacancy data into official occupational classifications using a novel application of text analysis. The effects of mismatch on aggregate UK productivity and output are driven by dispersion in regional or occupational productivity, tightness, and matching efficiency.

We further separate the identified macro shocks from financial shocks using narrative information, requiring that macro uncertainty rises during close elections. These are events which are likely to lead to macro uncertainty but are disjoint from a weakening in financial conditions.

Two other studies use international data with different degrees of granularity. International spillovers into lending to the private sector do occur, especially for US policies, and bank-specific heterogeneity influences the magnitudes of transmission. The effects are supportive of the international bank lending channel and the portfolio channel of monetary policy transmission. They also show that the frictions that banks face matter; in particular, foreign currency funding and hedging considerations can be a key source of heterogeneity. The forms of bank balance sheet heterogeneity that differentiate spillovers across banks are not uniform across countries.

To do so, we construct an agent-based model of a market for a financial asset in which trading occurs through a central limit order book. The model consists of heterogeneous agents with different trading strategies and frequencies, and is calibrated to high-frequency time series data on the sterling-US dollar exchange rate. Flash episodes occur in the model due to the procyclical behaviour of high-frequency market participants. This is aligned with some empirical evidence as to the drivers of real-world flash crashes. We find that the prevalence of flash episodes increases with the frequency with which high-frequency market participants trade compared to their low-frequency counterparts. This provides tentative theoretical evidence that the recent growth in high-frequency trading across some markets has led to flash episodes. Furthermore, we adapt the model so that large movements in price trigger temporary halts in trading (ie circuit breakers).

Predicated on ideal release conditions, we test the\u00a0performance of macroprudential buffers based on \u2018anti-procyclicality\u2019 mechanisms in current regulations. These mechanisms can reduce\u00a0the fire-sale externality in some market conditions, but not all. Conceptually, we devise alternative mechanisms that eliminate the\u00a0externality, although it may be difficult for policymakers to specify these in practice. Finally, as an alternative to quantity-based\u00a0solutions, we investigate the ability of taxes to reduce the externality. We find that such a price-based solution could also\u00a0eliminate the externality if set appropriately, but this would require a high tax rate and the redistribution of significant tax\u00a0revenues.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2018/macroprudential-margins-a-new-countercyclical-tool.pdf?la=en&hash=E8DAC67002D3FDF6BEC467C3A5DB9BDD8668A604", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2018/macroprudential-margins-a-new-countercyclical-tool.pdf?la=en&hash=E8DAC67002D3FDF6BEC467C3A5DB9BDD8668A604"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2018/macroprudential-margins-a-new-countercyclical-tool.pdf?la=en&hash=E8DAC67002D3FDF6BEC467C3A5DB9BDD8668A604", "path": "full/a513f4fea0a55c5bb1d2e654eaf2b36bb023ba30", "checksum": "f95ca86d8135eec508771036f1ecc656", "status": "uptodate"}]},

We confirm these predictions using a rich dataset of macroprudential FX regulations. These empirical tests show that FX regulations: (1) are effective in terms of reducing borrowing in foreign currency by banks; (2) have the unintended consequence of simultaneously causing firms to increase FX debt issuance; (3) reduce the sensitivity of banks to exchange rate movements, but (4) are less effective at reducing the sensitivity of corporates and the broader financial market to exchange rate movements.

Determining these hyper-parameters by selecting the values that maximize the marginal likelihood of the Bayesian VAR provides a method for isolating subsets of DSGE parameter priors that are at odds with the data. We illustrate the ability of our approach to correctly detect incorrect DSGE priors for the variance of structural shocks using a Monte Carlo experiment. We also demonstrate how posterior estimates of the DSGE parameter vector can be recovered from the BVAR posterior estimates: a new \u2018quasi-Bayesian\u2019 DSGE estimation.

The macroeconomic effects are well documented, but the effect on business decisions much less so. In this paper, we explore corporate data to investigate how economic uncertainty affected investment, dividend payouts and cash holdings, based on over 10,000 UK firm-year observations. We offer new insights into the relationship between business decisions and uncertainty, by exploiting two surveys of macroeconomic uncertainty from professional forecasters and CFOs collected by the Bank of England. These data demonstrate that heightened economic uncertainty lowered investment even after controlling for investment opportunities, sales growth, and the firm\u2019s own stock volatility. Economic uncertainty also explains the rise in cash holdings and the fall in payouts. Hence, our results help explain why UK firms invested so little and held so much cash at a time of historically low interest rates, and also why they paid out smaller dividends. These results may help explain recent sluggish productivity in the UK economy, and they also are important, because they provide a benchmark for future studies of Brexit-related uncertainty.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2018/business-investment-cash-holding-and-uncertainty-since-the-great-financial-crisis.pdf?la=en&hash=0DC7046892F5EEF45C95C28225937CFB8CA7A20B", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2018/business-investment-cash-holding-and-uncertainty-since-the-great-financial-crisis.pdf?la=en&hash=0DC7046892F5EEF45C95C28225937CFB8CA7A20B"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2018/business-investment-cash-holding-and-uncertainty-since-the-great-financial-crisis.pdf?la=en&hash=0DC7046892F5EEF45C95C28225937CFB8CA7A20B", "path": "full/4f4d4d5324165370a627b0d4c130cdf90fa3970a", "checksum": "0cda0f110e8ff4c91164015e967919eb", "status": "uptodate"}]},

Breaks in the forecast performance of a model can potentially incur important policy costs.

We develop a procedure which aims at capturing the policy cost of missing a break. We use data-based rules to find the test size that optimally trades off the costs associated with false positives with those that can result from a break going undetected for too long. In so doing, we also explicitly study forecast errors as a multivariate system. The covariance between forecast errors for different series, though often overlooked in the forecasting literature, not only enables us to consider testing in a multivariate setting but also increases the test power.

The presence of a bank from the importing country is also associated with higher exports in sectors with more opaque products.

We are able to establish evidence for both a bank funding and bank portfolio channel of monetary policy, for both Hong Kong and the United Kingdom.

Using only traditional sign restrictions, we find that the real effects of macroeconomic uncertainty shocks are generally weaker than proxies suggest and that the effects depend on a subsequent rise in financial uncertainty and credit spreads to have a negative impact on GDP. Exploiting narrative events such as the disorderly exit from the Exchange Rate Mechanism, the dot-com recession and the financial crisis support this finding.

To do so, it sets out a structural model of firms\u2019 equity to assess their investment behaviour under different regulatory regimes.  It finds that, while Solvency II may partly protect insurers\u2019 solvency positions from falls in risky asset prices, the new regulations might encourage certain types of UK life insurers to de-risk - that is, move to holding safe assets in place of risky - following falls in risk-free interest rates. This behaviour is driven by changes in the so-called \u2018risk margin\u2019, which, under its current design within the Solvency II framework, reduces insurers\u2019 solvency positions following falls in risk-free interest rates, thereby encouraging them to sell risky assets to reduce their probability of regulatory insolvency. The model also suggests that, once Solvency II is fully implemented by 2032, UK life insurers may have markedly reduced their holdings of long-term, risky assets. In the model, this behaviour is also driven by the risk margin, which, by increasing the volatility of insurers\u2019 solvency, encourages them to de-risk to reduce the variance of their asset portfolios.

The archival data we use provides granular, loan-level insight on the price and quantity of credit, and information on its distribution to particular counterparties. We find that the Bank\u2019s behaviour during this period broadly conforms to Bagehot\u2019s rule, though with variation across the crises of 1847, 1857 and 1866. Using a new, higher frequency series on the Bank\u2019s balance sheet, we find that the Bank did lend freely, with the number of discounts and advances increasing during crises. These loans were typically granted at a rate above pre-crisis levels and, in 1857 and 1866, typically at a spread above Bank Rate, though we also find some instances in the daily discount ledgers where individual loans were made below Bank rate in 1847. Another set of customer ledgers shows that the securities the Bank purchased were debts owed by a geographically and industrially diverse set of debtors. And using new data on the Bank\u2019s income and dividends, we find the Bank and its shareholders profited from lender of last resort operations.

Modern models of the term structure of interest rates typically fail to capture jointly time and cross-curve dependencies and are not used for stress-testing purposes. Our methodology is able to jointly model the temporal and cross-country dependence structure of interest rate curves and associate movements in the interest rates and cross-country spreads with movements in macroeconomic variables as well as market-wide and country-specific measures of liquidity and credit quality. We apply our methodology to generate contemporaneous stressed scenarios to a set of European yield curves.

Compositional changes in the labour force that improved aggregate search intensity prior to the 2008 recession will tend to obscure the decline in aggregate matching efficiency unless controlled for properly. Considering broader definitions of job seekers that include marginally-attached workers and on-the-job searchers exacerbates the registered decline in matching efficiency.

Traditional approaches to CCPs\u2019 margin requirements typically assume a simple closeout profile, and do not account for the \u2018real-life\u2019 constraints embedded on the management of a default. The paper proposes an approach of evaluating how distinct closeout strategies may expose a CCP to different sets of risk and costs, and consequently could impact the sufficiency of financial resources to cover its risk exposure to a default. The approach is based on a counterfactual simulation, and evaluates a full spectrum of hedging strategies in an exploratory and model-free manner, deriving endogenous and market-dependent risk metrics. Using the trade repository data available to the Bank (as a result of EMIR reporting) on over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps (IRS) and ten years (ie 2005 to 2015) of information on related market risk factors, the paper derives empirically an efficient hedging strategy that minimizes the CCP\u2019s risk exposure to a defaulting clearing member.

We identify monetary policy and financial shocks by combining the external instruments approach with sign restrictions in a two-country SVAR for the United States and the United Kingdom. Adverse US financial shocks trigger a sharp and persistent contraction in the US economy, and an increase in US credit spreads. Crucially, this tightening in US credit conditions is quickly transmitted internationally, leading to an increase in credit spreads and a slowdown in economic activity in the United Kingdom. Unlike financial shocks, monetary policy shocks do not seem to induce as much international co-movement.

In addition to GDP we examine other metrics of severity, including unemployment and labour productivity. We find that a period of rapid credit growth in the immediate run-up to a recession predicts a deeper and longer downturn than when credit growth has been subdued, whether associated with a systemic banking crisis or not and whether that credit growth reflects borrowing by households or businesses. Credit growth is a more statistically and economically significant predictor of a recession\u2019s severity than the level of indebtedness, though there is some evidence that the effect of a credit boom is greater when leverage is high.

The framework considers two distinct dealer functions: that of provider of repo financing (to prospective bond market participants) and that of market-maker. The cost and ability of dealers to provide these services under different regulatory constraints determines the price impact of a given trade on the market \u2014 or the level of \u2018market liquidity premia\u2019. In the model the impact on market liquidity varies for different levels of market volatility or \u2018stress\u2019. We find that under normal market conditions estimates of corporate bond liquidity risk premia are higher under the new regulations, but also that corporate bond market liquidity is more resilient due to better-capitalised dealers continuing to intermediate markets under higher levels of market stress than pre-crisis. Mapping these changes in liquidity premia to GDP, via their impact on the cost of borrowing for corporates in the real economy, the results of the model suggest that under normal market conditions there may be a greater cost of regulation via corporate bond markets than incorporated in earlier studies.

Initial margin requirements are typically calculated using risk-based margin models, and these models must be tested to ensure that they are prudent. However, two different margin models can calculate substantially different levels of margin yet both pass the usual tests. This paper presents a new approach to parameter selection based on the statistical properties of the worst loss over a margin period of risk estimated by the margin model under test. This measure is related to risk estimated at a fixed confidence interval yet leads to a more powerful test which is better able to justify the choice of parameters used in margin models. The test proposed is used on a variety of volatility estimation techniques applied to a long history of returns of the S&P 500 index. Well known techniques, including exponentially weighted moving average volatility estimation and generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity approaches are considered, and novel approaches derived from signal processing are also analysed.

The finding supports the claim that in part exorbitant privilege is a general characteristic of the issuer of the global reserve currency and not unique to the late twentieth century US.

Because private sector forecasts are not bound to be equal to central banks\u2019 forecasts, what markets label as unexpected may or may not be unanticipated by the central bank. Monetary surprises can thus incorporate anticipatory effects if market participants fail to account for the systematic component of policy when they are surprised by an interest rate decision. Depending on how market participants perceive the policy decision, their economic projections and the associated risk compensations move in opposite directions, and do so at the time of the announcement. Hence, and regardless of the width of the measurement window, monetary surprises capture more than just the monetary policy shock, and their use as external instruments for identification is potentially compromised. A New-Keynesian framework sketches the intuition. The resulting distortions in the estimated impulse response functions can be dramatic, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

This paper documents differences in the levels of application of prudential requirements drawing on a survey of national rules and regulations in eight jurisdictions. Most jurisdictions apply prudential requirements on a consolidated basis, meaning that they require groups to meet standards for minimum capital and liquidity adequacy as if they constituted a single financial unit. However, consolidated requirements do not account for potential impediments to the transferability of financial resources within banking groups. Reflecting this, international banking standards suggest prudential requirements should be applied also at lower levels. The Basel Accord sets out two alternatives for applying prudential requirements beneath the consolidated level: solo application and sub-consolidation. Solo application involves applying prudential standards to individual operating banks within a group, as if those banks were separate standalone entities; sub-consolidation involves regulating sub-groupings of entities as if those sub-groupings were themselves a single financial unit. These approaches have differing implications with respect to the allocation of financial resources across the legal entities within banking groups. However, in practice different jurisdictions arrive at similar outcomes through their differentiated application of certain other regulations, notably restrictions on intragroup exposures.

To what extent do the effects of monetary shocks depend on the information disclosed by the central bank? This paper investigates the effect of monetary shocks and shocks to the Bank of England\u2019s inflation and output projections on the term structure of UK private inflation expectations, to shed light on private agents\u2019 interpretation of central bank signals about policy and the macroeconomic outlook. We proceed in three steps. First, we correct our dependent variables \u2014 market-based inflation expectation measures \u2014 for potential risk, liquidity and inflation risk premia. Second, we extract exogenous shocks following Romer and Romer (2004)\u2019s identification approach. Third, we estimate the linear and interacted effects of these shocks in an empirical framework derived from the information frictions literature. We find that private inflation expectations respond negatively to contractionary monetary policy shocks, consistent with the usual transmission mechanism. In contrast, we find that inflation expectations respond positively to positive central bank inflation or output projection shocks, suggesting private agents put more weight on the signal that they convey about future economic developments than about the policy outlook. However, when shocks to central bank inflation projections are interacted with shocks to output projections of the same sign, they have no effect on inflation expectations, suggesting that private agents understand the functioning of the central bank reaction function and put more weight on the policy signal when there is no trade-off. We also find that the effects of contractionary monetary shocks are amplified when they are accompanied by positive shocks to central bank inflation projections.

This paper assesses the impact of reforms to the Bank of England\u2019s operating framework over the last two decades. These reforms have been successful in reducing overnight volatility. A new framework in 2006 which introduced reserves averaging and voluntary reserve targets was associated with lower volatility of overnight rates. Further reductions in volatility were associated with interim reforms and communications prior to the launch of this new framework. The injection of excess reserves under the floor system introduced in 2009 has been associated with a further reduction in volatility. Despite these encouraging findings, further analysis shows that the volatility of overnight rates had little effect on the volatility of longer-term rates except in the pre-2006 \u2018zero reserves\u2019 period and no effect at all on three-month Libor rates, which are the key benchmark for many derivatives and bank loans.

Second, we take a portmanteau approach and estimate a number of different performance-based competition measures common in the literature to support conclusions on the intensity of competition over the period.

However, the deposit-taker business model bundles together activities in several markets simultaneously, so strong competition in some markets can be offset by the extraction of market rents in others.

Using the recursiveness assumption and conditional on shocks of one standard deviation, we show that (i) financial shocks hitting during times of recessions create disproportionately more severe contractions in output; (ii) output growth shocks hitting in financially stressful times result in disproportionately further financial stress; (iii) monetary policy shocks hitting in recessionary times create more severe contractions in output.

Structural reforms can entail short-run output costs unless offset by a demand expansion. When monetary policy is constrained and cannot carry out this short-run expansion, there is a potential role for fiscal policy. In this case, reforms can go against fiscal consolidation in the short run, although they are expected to improve public finances in the long run. The aim of this paper is to quantify the short-run fiscal costs and long-run fiscal benefits of reforms, and investigate how the design of reforms can affect this trade-off. The focus is on the euro area, which has been particularly affected by high unemployment. In the model, both the costs and benefits of reforms are generally small, although increasingly large reforms entail larger rises in deficit-to-GDP in the short run. Results suggest that reforms in labour markets have little effect on public finances in the long run, but their short-run costs can be ameliorated by combining them with product market reforms.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2016/fiscal-consequences-of-structural-reform-under-constrained-monetary-policy.pdf?la=en&hash=03C27E58CB04AA79751D0D098305AE781822FE10", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2016/fiscal-consequences-of-structural-reform-under-constrained-monetary-policy.pdf?la=en&hash=03C27E58CB04AA79751D0D098305AE781822FE10"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2016/fiscal-consequences-of-structural-reform-under-constrained-monetary-policy.pdf?la=en&hash=03C27E58CB04AA79751D0D098305AE781822FE10", "path": "full/ce808235cdd1e9a7e870dd8e5c966cefed45cdcc", "checksum": "735f8af090f7548cd9d43853cbae0aed", "status": "uptodate"}]},

Meaningful restrictions are imposed on the model parameters, so as to attain local stationarity and bounded mean values. In particular, we consider time variation in both coefficients and volatility, emphasizing how the two interact. The model is applied to the analysis of inflation dynamics. Allowing for heavy tails leads to significant improvements in terms of fit and forecast. The adoption of the Student-t distribution proves to be crucial in order to obtain well-calibrated density forecasts. These results are obtained using US CPI inflation rate and are confirmed for other indicators of inflation as well as the CPI inflation of the other G7 countries. Finally, we show how the proposed approach generalizes various adaptive algorithms used in the literature.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2016/adaptive-models-and-heavy-tails.pdf?la=en&hash=D98D44DA147ED517D33EE57FAB485B27CFB2B4C5", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2016/adaptive-models-and-heavy-tails.pdf?la=en&hash=D98D44DA147ED517D33EE57FAB485B27CFB2B4C5"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2016/adaptive-models-and-heavy-tails.pdf?la=en&hash=D98D44DA147ED517D33EE57FAB485B27CFB2B4C5", "path": "full/f5aebcf75935c98d88c2be567bb543cff0c2e893", "checksum": "3abbd26d81c9da2833589c7cb74cbbb1", "status": "uptodate"}]},

Initial margin requirements are usually determined by risk-based models. These models typically require increased margin in stressed conditions: they are procyclical. This procyclicality causes a liquidity burden on market participants which sometimes falls when they are least able to bear it. In this paper we study a variety of tools which have been proposed to mitigate the procyclicality of initial margin requirements. Three of these tools are proposed in European regulation; the other two are new proposals which offer attractive procyclicality mitigation features. The behaviour of all five tools is studied in a simulation framework. We examine the extent to which each tool mitigates procyclicality, and at what cost in demanding unnecessary margin compared to a benchmark unmitigated model. Our findings indicate that all of the tools are useful in mitigating procyclicality to some extent, but that the optimal calibration of each tool in a particular situation depends on the relative weights placed by the modeller on the objectives of minimizing procyclicality on the one hand and minimizing undesirable overmargining in periods of low volatility on the other.

Over the same period, nominal investment rates fell, while house prices and household debt ratios rose. I explain these four trends with a fifth \u2014 the widespread fall in the relative price of investment goods. I present a simple \u00a0closed-economy OLG model in which households finance retirement in part by selling claims on the corporate sector accumulated over their working lives. With lower capital goods prices, a given quantity of saving buys more capital goods, but the increase in the real capital-output ratio lowers the marginal product. This has ambiguous effects on interest rates in the long run: if capital and labour are complements, in line with most estimates in the literature, interest rates remain low even if the relative price of capital stabilises. Lower interest rates reduce the user cost of housing, raise house prices and, given that housing is bought early in life, increase household debt. Housing is another vehicle for retirement saving, so omitting housing from the model exacerbates the fall in interest rates. I extend the model to allow for bequests and a heterogeneous bequest motive, and show that wealth inequality rises but consumption inequality falls when capital goods prices fall. Adding a third factor of production can reconcile the recent fall in the investment rate with the fall in the labour share. I test the model on cross-country data and find support for its assumptions and predictions. The analysis in this paper shows recent debates on macroeconomic imbalances and household and government indebtedness in a new light. In particular, low real interest rates may be the new normal. The debt of the young provides an alternative outlet for the retirement savings of the old; preventing the accumulation of debt, for example through macroprudential policy, leads to a bigger fall in interest rates.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2015/why-are-real-interest-rates-so-low-secular-stagnation-and-the-relative-price-of-investment-goods.pdf?la=en&hash=A280D3BB721387BC3EB09676FA27EAC30143E404", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2015/why-are-real-interest-rates-so-low-secular-stagnation-and-the-relative-price-of-investment-goods.pdf?la=en&hash=A280D3BB721387BC3EB09676FA27EAC30143E404"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2015/why-are-real-interest-rates-so-low-secular-stagnation-and-the-relative-price-of-investment-goods.pdf?la=en&hash=A280D3BB721387BC3EB09676FA27EAC30143E404", "path": "full/b672178a68310ea91f207f05a7ec7b0172ecee59", "checksum": "5b576641d5e3365c357efff5b8727e34", "status": "uptodate"}]},

We assume that the policy maker makes a state-contingent commitment to hold the policy rate at the zero lower bound (ZLB) in a way that ensures that specific macroeconomic variables (eg inflation) do not breach particular \u2018thresholds\u2019. In common with other similar policies, threshold-based forward guidance (TBFG) can be used to stimulate the economy at the ZLB via a commitment to hold the policy rate lower-for-longer than would otherwise have been the case. But TBFG also acts as a hedge against the asymmetric effects of shocks. That is because if further adverse shocks arise, prolonging the recession, exit would be expected to occur later and the policy would provide additional stimulus. In contrast, if positive shocks arrive, so that the economy recovers more quickly than originally expected, exit would be expected to occur sooner, thereby removing some of the policy stimulus.

Moreover, in the United Kingdom inflation-linked market instruments reference RPI inflation, whereas the MPC\u2019s target is CPI inflation of 2%.

We then further decompose risk premia estimates into inflation risk premia and liquidity risk premia. We show that long-horizon expectations of CPI inflation, as implied by our model, fell in the 1990s after the introduction of inflation targeting and the creation of the MPC and have since remained fairly stable at around 2%.

The baseline model is an application of the De Long, Shleifer, Summers and Waldmann (1990) model of noise traders to the housing market, when the risky asset is housing. This adds new features to the model as households receive utility from housing services and cannot short-sell houses. The existence of noise traders in the housing market creates uncertainty about house prices, causes prices to deviate away from their fundamental values, and leads to a distortion in housing consumption. To investigate the impact of housing derivatives trading on the housing market, a new financial instrument, housing futures, is introduced into the baseline model. Housing futures trading affects house price stability through three channels: by (i) enabling households to disentangle their housing consumption decisions from investment decisions; (ii) allowing short-selling; and (iii) attracting an additional set of traders (pure speculators) looking for portfolio diversification opportunities. The results show that, for a large set of admissible parameter values, housing futures trading decreases the volatility of house prices and increases the welfare of households and investors when noise trader (sophisticated) households are always relatively optimistic (pessimistic), and the share of pure speculators that are sophisticated is higher than the share of households that are sophisticated.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2015/stabilising-house-prices-the-role-of-housing-futures-trading.pdf?la=en&hash=B72990DA2F2286CDBED441CFB995D27E5CD0B5CF", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2015/stabilising-house-prices-the-role-of-housing-futures-trading.pdf?la=en&hash=B72990DA2F2286CDBED441CFB995D27E5CD0B5CF"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2015/stabilising-house-prices-the-role-of-housing-futures-trading.pdf?la=en&hash=B72990DA2F2286CDBED441CFB995D27E5CD0B5CF", "path": "full/aaf5ff25fa4369a989b7c04ce73fe547e922b63b", "checksum": "07201dacf8d0282657deb6e1cbbff615", "status": "uptodate"}]},

The co-movement in rates across both advanced and emerging economies suggests a common driver: the global neutral real rate may have fallen. In this paper we attempt to identify which secular trends could have driven such a fall. Although there is huge uncertainty, under plausible assumptions we think we can account for around 400 basis points of the 450 basis points fall. Our quantitative analysis highlights slowing global growth as one force that may have pushed down on real rates recently, but shifts in saving and investment preferences appear more important in explaining the long-term decline. We think the global saving schedule has shifted out in recent decades due to demographic forces, higher inequality and to a lesser extent the glut of precautionary saving by emerging markets. Meanwhile, desired levels of investment have fallen as a result of the falling relative price of capital, lower public investment, and due to an increase in the spread between risk-free and actual interest rates. Moreover, most of these forces look set to persist and some may even build further. This suggests that the global neutral rate may remain low and perhaps settle at (or slightly below) 1% in the medium to long run.

Our results are, at first sight, different from the literature on regulatory arbitrage: we find that foreign banks expand their lending into host countries where regulation is tightened.

We find that house prices in emerging economies grow faster, are more volatile, less persistent and less synchronised across countries than in advanced economies. We also find that they correlate with capital flows more closely than in advanced economies. We then condition the analysis on an exogenous change to a particular component of capital flows: global liquidity, broadly understood as a proxy for the international supply of credit. We identify this shock by aggregating bank-to-bank cross-border credit flows and by using the external instrumental variable approach introduced by Stock and Watson and Mertens and Ravn. We find that in emerging markets a global liquidity shock has a much stronger impact on house prices and consumption than in advanced economies. We finally show that holding house prices constant in response to this shock tends to dampen its effects on consumption in both advanced and emerging economies, but possibly through different channels: in advanced economies by boosting the value of housing collateral and hence supporting domestic borrowing; in emerging markets, by appreciating the exchange rate and hence supporting the international borrowing capacity of the economy.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2015/global-liquidity-house-prices-and-the-macroeconomy-evidence-from-advanced-and-emerging-economies.pdf?la=en&hash=680F382AD28A5B70BE06A9ACC2A3C1D6713EB008", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2015/global-liquidity-house-prices-and-the-macroeconomy-evidence-from-advanced-and-emerging-economies.pdf?la=en&hash=680F382AD28A5B70BE06A9ACC2A3C1D6713EB008"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2015/global-liquidity-house-prices-and-the-macroeconomy-evidence-from-advanced-and-emerging-economies.pdf?la=en&hash=680F382AD28A5B70BE06A9ACC2A3C1D6713EB008", "path": "full/4f9848c67cdea868785fbd04a1b1a3e8070dbfb6", "checksum": "486421abdf981159f7606360953b5c9e", "status": "uptodate"}]},

This quest led institutions to develop Value-at-Risk (VaR) models for their trading portfolios in the 1990s. Subsequently, so-called filtered historical simulation VaR models have become popular tools due to their ability to incorporate information on recent market returns and thus produce risk estimates conditional on them. These estimates are often superior to the unconditional ones produced by the first generation of VaR models. This paper explores the properties of various filtered historical simulation models. We explain how these models are constructed and illustrate their performance, examining in particular how filtering transforms various properties of return distribution. The procyclicality of filtered historical simulation models is also discussed and compared to that of unfiltered VaR. A key consideration in the design of risk management models is whether the model\u2019s purpose is simply to estimate some percentile of the return distribution, or whether its aims are broader. We discuss this question and relate it to the design of the model testing framework. Finally, we discuss some recent developments in the filtered historical simulation paradigm and draw some conclusions about the use of models in this tradition for the estimation of initial margin requirements.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2015/filtered-historical-simulation-value-at-risk-models-and-their-competitors.pdf?la=en&hash=34BF0E24DB60656E044E3DB5524E08DF5D0112D3", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2015/filtered-historical-simulation-value-at-risk-models-and-their-competitors.pdf?la=en&hash=34BF0E24DB60656E044E3DB5524E08DF5D0112D3"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2015/filtered-historical-simulation-value-at-risk-models-and-their-competitors.pdf?la=en&hash=34BF0E24DB60656E044E3DB5524E08DF5D0112D3", "path": "full/60faf9a44a8ded509138a48392971d2730a64cb0", "checksum": "83fef4be4e543168da4d20ccb5ebd65e", "status": "uptodate"}]},

The performance of forecasts from all three sources deteriorates substantially following the financial crisis. The deterioration is particularly marked for the DSGE model\u2019s GDP forecasts. One possible explanation for that, and a key difference between DSGE models and judgemental forecasts, is that judgemental forecasts are implicitly conditioned on a broader information set, including faster-moving indicators that may be particularly informative when the state of the economy is evolving rapidly, as in periods of financial distress. Consistent with that interpretation, GDP forecasts from a version of the DSGE model augmented to include a survey measure of short-term GDP growth expectations are competitive with the judgemental forecasts at all horizons in the post-crisis period.

Second, when the interest rate is the only available policy instrument, a monetary authority subject to the same constraints as private agents cannot always achieve a (constrained) efficient allocation and faces a trade-off between macroeconomic and financial stability in response to contractionary shocks.

This is due to policymakers in both economies responding to foreign productivity and discount factor shocks that cause persistent changes in inflation.

It can be difficult to tell whether the\u00a0variations are intentional or whether they occur due to external factors that are beyond the control of the individual banks. We use a recombinant approach to detect instances where observed patterns of liquidity provision are unlikely to have occurred absent of some behavioural or structural factors, such as differences in banks\u2019 business models. Our results suggest that the variations in liquidity provision are larger than would be expected from truly random payment flows.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2014/variations-in-liquidity-provision-in-real-time-payment-systems.pdf?la=en&hash=2D338F4E42F205C97517F7082B8DDF1DD031E3A4", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2014/variations-in-liquidity-provision-in-real-time-payment-systems.pdf?la=en&hash=2D338F4E42F205C97517F7082B8DDF1DD031E3A4"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2014/variations-in-liquidity-provision-in-real-time-payment-systems.pdf?la=en&hash=2D338F4E42F205C97517F7082B8DDF1DD031E3A4", "path": "full/55acde7f8c8cf288ab4d3701cdffee0498da0f24", "checksum": "71a7df193bfc472b6263521d057091ec", "status": "uptodate"}]},

I find that, under the regulatory environment existing before the crisis, institutions that ultimately resorted to more intensive efforts (ie debt-equity swaps, mergers with/acquisitions by stronger competitors and outright closure) to deal with financial difficulties had significantly weaker financial profiles as measured by a set of attributes reflecting capital adequacy, asset quality, management skills, earnings performance and liquidity.

This paper uses firm-level data from the Office for National Statistics Annual Business Survey and the Inter-Departmental Business Register to better understand the nature of this weakness. Overall, our findings are consistent with existing literature which finds that within-firm productivity growth tends to be procyclical and emphasises the importance of the reallocation of resources between firms and sectors for productivity growth. More specifically, we find that up until 2011 there was a doubling in the proportion of firms with shrinking output and flat employment. This suggests that firms were able to respond flexibly to weak demand conditions by retaining staff at the expense of measured productivity, suggestive of an opening up of spare capacity within firms. However, the strength of recent hiring behaviour since 2012 means that this is now likely to be less of a factor. The lack of labour shedding, together with a low firm exit rate, is also indicative of low levels of resource reallocation between firms and sectors. To assess the importance of this to aggregate productivity growth we apply the method used by Baily, Bartelsman and Haltiwanger. We find that reallocation between firms (in terms of both the movement of labour and firm entry and exit) contributed significantly to aggregate productivity growth before the crisis, but its contribution fell substantially after. In fact, around one third of the productivity slowdown after 2007 can be attributed to slower reallocation of resources. The extent to which reduced factor reallocation, and so the weakness in productivity growth, persists remains a key question for the economic outlook.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2014/the-productivity-puzzle-a-firm-level-investigation-into-employment.pdf?la=en&hash=E880774027E6284FE498964717690E8611D08925", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2014/the-productivity-puzzle-a-firm-level-investigation-into-employment.pdf?la=en&hash=E880774027E6284FE498964717690E8611D08925"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2014/the-productivity-puzzle-a-firm-level-investigation-into-employment.pdf?la=en&hash=E880774027E6284FE498964717690E8611D08925", "path": "full/54582fb4f29b24019bc8ebe43b3af437ef1c6eee", "checksum": "0756c1a41835c9ace21d6e865120e787", "status": "uptodate"}]},

But our standard\u00a0macroeconomic models are not well suited to analysing this sector. In this paper, we try to address these deficiencies by modelling better the service sector and then examine the implications of trying to take certain features of the service sector into account. In order to do this, we first embarked on a series of structured visits to a set of firms that span the service sector. The motivation for doing this was that we could use our findings from these visits to get a better feel for how service sector firms operate and, so, to be able to construct a model of a \u2018typical\u2019 service sector firm. We then build a model taking into account what we found from the visits and examined the effects of demand shocks within the model.

Regulatory efforts to influence the aggregate supply of credit may be thwarted to some degree by \u2018leakages\u2019, as other credit suppliers substitute for the variation induced in the supply of credit by regulated banks. Credit substitution could occur through foreign banks operating domestic branches that are not subject to capital regulation by the domestic supervisor, or through bond and stock markets. The UK experience for the period 1998\u20132007 is ideally suited to address these questions, given its unique regulatory history (UK bank regulators imposed bank-specific and time-varying capital requirements on regulated banks), the substantial presence of both domestically regulated and foreign regulated banks, and the United Kingdom\u2019s deep capital markets.

UK banks were subject to both time-varying capital requirements and changes in interest rate policy. Tightening of either capital requirements or monetary policy reduces the supply of lending. Lending by large banks reacts substantially to capital requirement changes, but not to monetary policy changes. Lending by small banks reacts to both. There is little evidence of interaction between these two policy instruments. The differences in the responses of small and large banks, and the lack of interaction between capital requirement changes and monetary policy, have important policy implications.

In addition we employ an empirical framework with time-varying parameters to allow us to see how the impact of oil price shocks may have developed over time. In line with earlier studies on larger economies, we find that the source of the shock does indeed affect the size and nature\u00a0of the eventual impact on the UK economy. Oil supply shocks typically lead to larger negative impacts on output and slightly higher increases in inflation relative to oil shocks stemming from shocks to world demand, which typically have smaller and largely positive, impacts on UK output. We find evidence that the nature of shocks in the world oil market has changed over time, with the oil price becoming more sensitive to changes in oil production.

A model which allows a financial crisis to have both a short-run effect on the growth rate of labour productivity and a long-run effect on its level is estimated on a panel of\u00a061 countries over 1955-2010.

It finds that credit supply shocks can account for most of the weakness in bank lending since the onset of the crisis and between a third and a half of the fall in GDP relative to its historic trend. It also finds that credit supply shocks appear to behave more like aggregate supply shocks than aggregate demand shocks because they cause output and inflation to move in opposite directions. This may be because credit supply shocks affect potential supply in the economy or because they have a significant exchange rate effect.

Using this extended SVAR model we estimate that a one standard deviation increase in the volatility of the shock to US real GDP leads to a decline in UK GDP growth of 0.1% and a 0.1% increase in UK CPI inflation. We then use a non-linear small open economy New Keynesian business cycle model calibrated to US/UK economies to investigate what kind of stochastic volatility shocks can deliver such behaviour. We find that shocks that generate marginal cost uncertainty - such as foreign wage mark-up and productivity stochastic volatility shocks - can reproduce the macroeconomic aggregate responses obtained by the empirical model.

We apply our estimates of the impact of QE on the money supply to a set of \u2018monetarist\u2019 econometric models that articulate the extent to which asset prices and spending need to adjust to make the demand for money consistent with the increased broad money supply associated with QE. Our preferred, central case estimate is that an 8% increase in money holdings may have pushed down on yields by an average of around 150 basis points in 2010 and increased asset values by approximately 20%. This in turn would have had a peak impact on output of 2% by the start of 2011, with an impact on inflation of 1 percentage point around a year later.

For example: What role do large banks play in systemic risk? How should capital adequacy standards recognize this role? How is stability shaped by concentration and diversification in the financial system? We explore these questions using a deliberately simplified, dynamical model of a banking system which combines three different channels for direct spillovers from one bank to another: liquidity hoarding, asset price contagion, and the propagation of defaults via counterparty credit risk. Importantly, we also introduce a mechanism for capturing how swings in \u2018confidence\u2019 in the system may contribute to instability. Our results highlight that the importance of relatively large, well-connected banks in system stability scales more than proportionately with their size: the impact of their collapse arises not only from their connectivity, but also from their effect on confidence in the system. Imposing tougher capital requirements on larger banks than smaller ones can thus enhance the resilience of the system. Moreover, these effects are more pronounced in more concentrated systems, and continue to apply even when allowing for potential diversification benefits which may be realised by larger banks.

For that, we use a unique transactions data set for four UK stocks, over the period of a randomly selected week. Our data identifies the counterparties to each transaction, enabling us to track the trading behaviour of individual HFTs. We first find that HFTs differ significantly from each other in terms of liquidity provision: while some HFTs mostly consume liquidity (ie trade more \u2018aggressively\u2019) by primarily executing trades via market orders, others mostly supply liquidity (ie trade more \u2018passively\u2019) by primarily executing trades via limit orders. To examine how trading behaviour is related to these patterns of liquidity provision, we split the HFTs in two groups, according to their trade aggressiveness, and examine the behaviour and impact of each group separately. We find that the \u2018passive\u2019 HFTs follow a trading strategy consistent with market making and as such their trades have alternating signs and are independent of recent (ten-second) price changes. By contrast, \u2018aggressive\u2019 HFTs exhibit persistence in the direction of their\u00a0trades and trade in line with the recent (ten-second) price trend. We then explore the relationship between HFT activity and market quality. We find that both higher price volatility and lower spreads cause HFT activity to increase. We suggest a number of reasons as to why this might be so. Finally, we use a tick time specification to examine the impact of HFT activity on price discovery (ie information-based volatility) and noise (ie excess volatility).

This paper examines micro evidence - lacking to date - on both questions, using a unique data set. In the United Kingdom, regulators have imposed time-varying, bank-specific minimum capital requirements since Basel I. Over the 1998-2007 period, UK-regulated banks reduced lending in response to tighter capital requirements. But non UK-regulated banks (resident foreign branches) increased lending in response to tighter capital requirements on a relevant reference group of regulated banks.

Because assets are imperfect substitutes, central bank asset purchases that alter the relative supplies of assets can influence their prices. In the model, aggregate demand depends on the prices (or interest rates) of both long-term and short-term bonds. To the extent that central bank asset purchases reduce long-term\u00a0interest rates (over and above the effect of expected future short rates), aggregate demand can be stimulated, leading to higher inflation through a standard New Keynesian Phillips Curve. However, the imperfect substitutability between bonds that gives asset purchases their traction also reduces the potency of conventional monetary policy because reductions in the short-term nominal interest rate reduce the relative supply of short-term bonds, increasing the premium on long-term bonds. Nevertheless, a policy in which the policymaker uses asset purchases as an additional policy instrument can improve outcomes in the face of a negative demand shock that drives the short-term policy rate to its lower bound.

Although Bank Rate, the UK policy rate, was reduced to \u00bd%, effectively its lower bound, the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee felt that additional measures were necessary to meet the inflation target in the medium term. The policy of QE entailed buying private and mainly public assets in large quantities using central bank money, with the aim of injecting money into the economy and boosting nominal spending, in order to help achieve the Bank\u2019s inflation\u00a0target. Over the period from March 2009 to January 2010, the Bank of England purchased \u00a3200 billion of assets, mainly consisting of government securities. We attempt to quantify the effects of these purchases by focusing on the impact of lower long-term interest rates on the wider economy. This is motivated by empirical evidence indicating that QE purchases reduced long-term UK government bond yields by about 100 basis points. Other transmission channels are also possible, but are not considered in this paper. We use three different models to conduct counterfactual simulations to estimate the impact of QE on output and inflation: a large Bayesian VAR; a change-point structural VAR; and a\u00a0time-varying parameter VAR. Our preferred average estimates from the three models suggest that QE may have had a peak effect on the level of real GDP of around 1\u00bd% and a peak effect on annual CPI inflation of about 1\u00bc percentage points.

There is a positive externality of effort that strongly interacts with asset distribution and contractual clauses. Individual litigation is not desirable from the creditors\u2019 point of view since it weakens the incentives to exert effort. Collective action clauses block litigation and maximise repayment, especially when creditors are heterogeneous in the amount of debt they hold. The adoption of seniority clauses modifies the incentives to exert effort and thus repayment. This effect can be positive or negative.

This paper develops a dynamic general equilibrium model to analyse the effect on interest rates, asset prices, investment, consumption, output, the exchange rate and the current account of a shift in portfolio preferences of foreign investors. The model has two countries and two asset classes (equities and bonds). It is characterised by imperfect substitutability between assets and allows for endogenous adjustment in interest rates and asset prices. Therefore, it accounts for capital gains arising from equity price movements, in addition to valuation effects caused by changes in the exchange rate. To illustrate the mechanics of the model, we calibrate it to analyse the consequences of an increase in the importance of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). Specifically, we ask what would happen if \u2018excess\u2019 reserves held by emerging markets were transferred from central banks to SWFs. We look separately at two diversification paths: one in which SWFs keep the same allocation across bonds and equities as central banks, but move away from dollar assets (path 1); and another in which they choose the same currency composition as central banks, but shift from US bonds to US equities (path 2). In path 1, the dollar depreciates and US net debt falls on impact and increases in the long run. In path 2, the dollar depreciates and US net debt increases in the long run. In both cases, there is a reduction in the \u2018exorbitant privilege\u2019, ie, the excess return the United States receives on its assets over what it pays on its liabilities.

The term structure in our model is determined through the interaction of risk-averse arbitrageurs and preferred-habitat investors with preferences for specific maturities. The model is estimated on US real rates during the 2000s and allows for two factors: one corresponding to the short rate and one to preferred-habitat demand. We find that the puzzling drop in long rates during 2004-05 (Greenspan conundrum) is driven by the demand factor.

The resulting modular structure reflects the flow of financial stress through the network, combining nodes that are most closely related in terms of the transmission of stress. The modular structure of the international banking network has changed dramatically over the past three decades. In the late 1980s four important financial centres formed one large supercluster that was highly contagious in terms of transmission of stress within its ranks, but less contagious on a global scale. Since then the most influential modules have become significantly smaller and more broadly contagious.

Previous work suggests three potential explanations for these events: expansionary monetary policy, capital inflows due to a global savings glut and excessive financial innovation combined with inappropriately lax financial regulation. In this study we examine the effects of these three factors on the housing market. We estimate a panel VAR for a sample of OECD countries and identify monetary policy and capital inflows shocks using sign restrictions. To explore how these effects change with the structure of the mortgage market and the degree of securitisation, we augment the VAR to let the coefficients vary with mortgage market characteristics. Our results suggest that both types of shocks have a significant and positive effect on real house prices, real credit to the private sector and real residential investment. The responses of housing variables to both types of shocks are stronger in countries with more developed mortgage markets, roughly doubling the responses to a monetary policy shock. The amplification effect of mortgage-backed securitisation is particularly strong for capital inflows shocks, increasing the response of real house prices, residential investment and real credit by a factor of two, three and five, respectively.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2011/low-interest-rates-and-housing-booms-the-role-of-capital-inflows.pdf?la=en&hash=63801CFBCA5DC935C982D22F12AEF554050B10BE", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2011/low-interest-rates-and-housing-booms-the-role-of-capital-inflows.pdf?la=en&hash=63801CFBCA5DC935C982D22F12AEF554050B10BE"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2011/low-interest-rates-and-housing-booms-the-role-of-capital-inflows.pdf?la=en&hash=63801CFBCA5DC935C982D22F12AEF554050B10BE", "path": "full/bdfdf1dae9eb7f71dc7c6ac9af444a30c795fea7", "checksum": "b18aa2bd8c6ac0498df6c3c2290553e3", "status": "uptodate"}]},

We also show that, in order to explain country-specific movements in yield curves, local factors are required. Although we implement a very general factor structure, we find that our global factors are related to global inflation and global economic activity, while local factors are closely linked to monetary policy rates. In this respect our results are similar to previous work. But an important advantage of our joint international model is that we are able to decompose interest rates into risk-free rates and risk premia. Additionally, we are able to study the implications for exchange rates.

We model time-variation through a Markov-switching structural vector autoregressive framework with variants of the sign restriction identification scheme to back out the time-varying effect of different structural shocks. We investigate the following questions: (i) How has the impact of the mix of real and nominal shocks on the UK economy evolved over time and did this have a specific impact on UK inflation expectations? and (ii) Has there been an autonomous impact of inflation expectations on the UK economy and has it changed over time? Our results suggest that shocks to inflation expectations had important effects on actual inflation in the 1970s, but this impact had significantly declined towards the end of our sample. This seems to be mainly due to a relatively slower response of monetary policy to these shocks in the 1970s compared to later years. Similarly, oil price shocks and real demand shocks led to important changes in macroeconomic variables in the 1970s. Beyond that period and up to the end of our sample oil price shocks became less significant for the dynamics of actual inflation and output growth. However real demand shocks became a relatively more important determinant for fluctuations in those series during the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s.

By February 2010, the MPC had made \u00a3200 billion of purchases, most of which had been of UK government securities (gilts). Based on analysis of the reaction of financial market prices and econometric estimates, this paper attempts to assess the impact of the Bank\u2019s QE policy on asset prices. Our estimates of the reaction of gilt prices to the programme suggest that QE may have depressed gilt yields by about 100 basis points. On balance the evidence seems to suggest that the largest part of the impact of QE came through a portfolio rebalancing channel.

Banks also responded to scarce regulatory capital by raising their deposit rate to attract funds. The international presence of UK banks allows us to identify a specific driver of capital shocks in our data, independent of bank lending to UK residents. Specifically, we use write-offs on loans to non-residents to instrument bank capital\u2019s impact on UK resident lending.

In terms of how companies set prices, the survey evidence supported the use of the mark-up over costs form of pricing. Firms reviewed prices more frequently than actually changing them, with the median firm changing price only once per year, but the frequency with which companies changed their prices varied considerably across sectors. Over the past decade a significant number of firms had increased the frequency of price changes. Different factors influenced price rises and price falls. Higher costs - in particular, labour costs and raw materials - were the most important driver behind price rises, whereas lower demand and competitors\u2019 prices were the main factor resulting in price falls.

This paper considers the relative importance of two of these hypotheses. First, global imbalances increased liquidity in the US financial system, driving down long-term real interest rates. Second, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low in the first half of the 2000s. Both factors reduced the cost of borrowing and may have encouraged the boom in house prices. This paper develops an empirical framework to separate the relative contributions of these two factors to the US housing market. The results suggest that capital inflows to the United States played a bigger role in generating the increase in house prices than monetary policy loosening. Using VAR methods, we find that compared to monetary policy, the effect of a capital inflows shock on US house prices and residential investment is about twice as large and substantially more persistent. Results from variance decompositions suggest that, at a forecast horizon of 20 quarters, capital flows shocks explain 15% of the variation in real house prices, while monetary policy shocks explain only 5%. In a simple counterfactual exercise, we find that if the ratio of the current account deficit to GDP had remained constant since the end of 1998, real house prices by the end of 2007 would have been 13% lower.

We model a stylised two-stream payment system where banks choose (a) how much liquidity to post and (b) which payments to route into each of two \u2018streams\u2019: the RTGS stream, and an LSM stream. Looking at equilibrium choices we find that, when liquidity is expensive, the two-stream system is more efficient than the vanilla RTGS system without an LSM. This is because the LSM achieves better co-ordination of payments, without introducing settlement risk. However, the two-stream system still only achieves a second-best in terms of efficiency: in many cases, a central planner could further decrease system-wide costs by imposing higher liquidity holdings, and without using the LSM at all. Hence, the appeal of the LSM resides in its ability to ease (but not completely solve) strategic inefficiencies stemming from externalities and free-riding. Second, \u2018bad\u2019 equilibria too are theoretically possible in the two-stream system. In these equilibria banks post large amounts of liquidity and at the same time overuse the LSM. The existence of such equilibria suggests that some co-ordination device may be needed to reap the full benefits of an LSM.

A number of banks, faced with random streams of payment orders, choose whether to link directly to the payment system, or to use a correspondent bank. Settling payments directly on the system imposes liquidity costs which depend on the maximum liquidity overdraft incurred during the day. On the other hand, using a correspondent entails paying a flat fee, charged by the correspondent to recoup liquidity costs and to extract a profit. We specify a protocol whereby one bank in each period can revisit its choice whether to link directly to the system, or to become clients of other banks, thus generating a dynamic client-correspondent network. We simulate this protocol, observing the emergence of different network structures.

First, the monetary transmission mechanism works not only via nominal rigidities but also via a reallocation of productive resources away from the most productive agents. Second, following an adverse productivity shock there is a dynamic trade-off between the immediate fall in output, which is an efficient response to the productivity fall, and the fall in output thereafter, which is caused by a reallocation of resources away from the most productive agents. The more the initial output fall is dampened with a temporary rise in inflation, the more the adverse future effects of the reallocation of resources are mitigated.

Two channels are investigated.

Second, innovations in wholesale payments technology help establish well-functioning interbank markets for end-of-day funds. This reduces the need for banks to hold excess reserves and thus helps credit creation. We examine these links empirically using payment systems reforms in Eastern European countries as our laboratory. We find evidence that reforms led to a \u2018crowding in\u2019 of cash in favour of demand deposits and that this in turn enabled a prolonged credit expansion in our sample countries.

The main result is that the transition from local to global liquidity management, and better co-ordination in settlement of foreign exchange transactions, have two effects.

In this paper, we consider the effect of fire sales and entry during crises on banks\u2019 ex-ante choice of liquid asset holdings. We consider a setting with limited pledgeability of risky cash flows relative to safe ones and a differential expertise between banks and outsiders in employing banking assets. When a large number of banks fail, market for assets clears only at fire-sale prices and outsiders enter the market if prices fall sufficiently low. In such states, there is a private benefit of liquid holdings to banks from purchasing assets. There is also a social benefit since greater banking system liquidity reduces inefficiency from liquidation of\u00a0assets to outsiders. When pledgeability of risky cash flows is high, for instance, in countries with well-developed capital markets, banks hold less liquidity than is socially optimal due to risk-shifting incentives; otherwise, banks may hold even more liquidity than is socially optimal to capitalise on fire sales. However, if there is a systemic cost associated with crises, for example, in the form of fiscal costs associated with provision of deposit insurance, then socially optimal liquidity may always be higher than the privately optimal one, and, in turn, regulation in the form of prudent liquidity requirements may be desirable.

During the inflation-targeting regime, monetary policy shocks have been more muted and inflation expectations have been lower than in the pre-1992 era. The link between the macroeconomy and the yield curve has also changed over time, with fluctuations in the\u00a0level factor becoming less important for inflation after the Bank of England independence in 1997. Policy rates appear to have responded more systematically to inflation and unemployment in the current regime. We use our time-varying macro-finance model to revisit the evidence on the expectations hypothesis.\u00a0", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2009/dynamics-of-the-term-structure-of-uk-interest-rates.pdf?la=en&hash=4031B0A82094268D8A839BC2F4BD0ADF6682AD23", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2009/dynamics-of-the-term-structure-of-uk-interest-rates.pdf?la=en&hash=4031B0A82094268D8A839BC2F4BD0ADF6682AD23"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2009/dynamics-of-the-term-structure-of-uk-interest-rates.pdf?la=en&hash=4031B0A82094268D8A839BC2F4BD0ADF6682AD23", "path": "full/fcecf6788c610951f5cb5aa3b4ccadba3f5bfc8c", "checksum": "5ac3d05fc01a4cb017b98828def0a6ed", "status": "uptodate"}]},

First, prices change very frequently in supermarkets, with 40% of prices changing each week, and even controlling for \u2018temporary\u2019 changes, a quarter of prices change each week. Importantly, there is evidence that focusing on monthly observations, rather than weekly ones, overstates the implied stickiness of prices. Second, the probability of price changes is not constant over time - all product categories have declining hazard functions. Third, the range of price changes is very wide, with some very large price cuts and price rises; but despite this, a significant number of price changes are very small. Fourth, there appears to be little link between the frequency and magnitude of price changes - prices that change less frequently do not tend to change by more. Fifth, the strongest correlation between price and volume changes is contemporaneous, suggesting that prices and volumes move together from week to week. And sixth, rough analysis based on simplifying assumptions suggests that consumers are fairly price sensitive: volumes change by more than prices.\u00a0", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2009/do-supermarket-prices-change-from-week-to-week.pdf?la=en&hash=2B99E4D7A759918D90FEFCEC1771E3C228535723", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2009/do-supermarket-prices-change-from-week-to-week.pdf?la=en&hash=2B99E4D7A759918D90FEFCEC1771E3C228535723"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2009/do-supermarket-prices-change-from-week-to-week.pdf?la=en&hash=2B99E4D7A759918D90FEFCEC1771E3C228535723", "path": "full/17800043df4607f95249069203942632a490fd1d", "checksum": "86c371e7276d7db73a8fb3510c1839e0", "status": "uptodate"}]},

First, size and, particularly, the composition of a country\u2019s external balance sheet are found to play an important role in the onset of crises. Second, EMEs seem to be more sensitive to external balance sheet variables than developed countries, and so too do economies with fixed or quasi-fixed exchange rate regimes. Third, further support is provided to standard theoretical explanations of currency crises. The likelihood of a crisis is found to increase with: the extent to which the real exchange rate rises above its trend; faster growth in broad money (relative to the level of international reserves); larger current account and budget balance deficits; lower GDP growth; and, if a neighbouring country already has a crisis. Economic fundamentals are also found to be a more important explanation of the onset of currency crises during the 1980s than during the 1990s, suggesting that more recent crises are less \u2018fundamentally\u2019 driven.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2009/common-determinants-of-currency-crises-role-of-external-balance-sheet-variables.pdf?la=en&hash=A5B7C333F6C2C0E988A14E19042F233456084BF1", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2009/common-determinants-of-currency-crises-role-of-external-balance-sheet-variables.pdf?la=en&hash=A5B7C333F6C2C0E988A14E19042F233456084BF1"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2009/common-determinants-of-currency-crises-role-of-external-balance-sheet-variables.pdf?la=en&hash=A5B7C333F6C2C0E988A14E19042F233456084BF1", "path": "full/502a22fa8b1b2990284dc76160773b3dadec82e7", "checksum": "9be8f2e09abed7d9a6213367fff6f7d2", "status": "uptodate"}]},

In particular, we are interested in payments behaviour towards a bank that is, for operational reasons, unable to make but able to receive payments. If other banks did not sufficiently monitor their outgoing payments, operational shocks could impact the entire payment system because the affected bank may absorb liquidity from the system. We first build a game-theoretic model in which a bank\u2019s decision to make payments depends both on whether another bank experiences operational problems, and on the time of day at which the outage occurs. We then investigate these reactions empirically using a non-parametric method. Our theory predicts that banks stop paying to a bank which has been unable to make payments early in the day, when they are uncertain about the payment instructions they might have to execute. When this uncertainty has been resolved (later in the day), healthy banks make payments even to a bank experiencing the operational problem. Both predictions are supported by the data.

But it was arguably the decline in international long real rates over this period which was more unusual and, by the end of 2007, long real rates in the United Kingdom remained at recent historical lows. In this paper, we try to shed light on the recent behaviour of long real rates, by estimating several empirical models of the term structure of real interest rates, derived from UK index-linked bonds. We adopt a standard 'finance' approach to modelling the real term structure, using an essentially affine framework. While being empirically tractable, these models impose the important theoretical restriction of no arbitrage, which enables us to decompose forward real rates into expectations of future short (ie risk-free) real rates and forward real term premia. One general finding that emerges across all the models estimated is that time-varying term premia appear to be extremely important in explaining movements in long real forward rates. Although there is some evidence that long-horizon expected short real rates declined over the conundrum period, our results suggest lower term premia played the dominant role in accounting for the fall in long real rates. This evidence could be consistent with the so-called 'search for yield' and excess liquidity explanations for the conundrum, but it might also partly reflect strong demand for index-linked bonds by institutional investors and foreign central banks.\u00a0", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2008/understanding-the-real-rate-conundrum.pdf?la=en&hash=3E9FE492673E0BC536502E251073F224A2CF13B6", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2008/understanding-the-real-rate-conundrum.pdf?la=en&hash=3E9FE492673E0BC536502E251073F224A2CF13B6"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2008/understanding-the-real-rate-conundrum.pdf?la=en&hash=3E9FE492673E0BC536502E251073F224A2CF13B6", "path": "full/a73fe2b6f7b76c2ee106bf291a3d26866903fec3", "checksum": "92e12d7c39f95e816711c92ddddaab1c", "status": "uptodate"}]},

This paper makes use of a simulation approach to quantify by how much tiering affects, on the one hand, concentration and credit risk and, on the other, the liquidity needs of CHAPS. We do so by creating scenarios where current settlement banks become customer banks and thus we increase the degree of tiering. The results show that concentration risk would rise substantially in what is already a highly concentrated system. As for credit risk, the size of intraday exposures compared with settlement banks' capital is very small and therefore the likelihood of contagion remote. More importantly, the increase in credit risk brought to the system by settlement banks leaving CHAPS bears little relationship to the values settled by each individual bank. We find that increasing the degree of tiering in CHAPS leads to substantial liquidity savings - although the liquidity saved is only a fraction of the spare liquidity currently posted in the system.

The paper looks at three different types of non-linearities: (a) non-proportional adjustment (the size of the adjustment grows more than proportionally with the size of the misalignments), (b) asymmetric adjustment to cost-increasing and cost-decreasing shocks, and (c) the existence of thresholds in the size of misalignments below which no adjustment takes place. There is evidence of more than proportional adjustment towards long-run equilibrium in manufacturing industries. In these industries, the adjustment is faster the further away mcurrent import prices are from their implied long-run equilibrium. In contrast, a proportional linear adjustment cannot be rejected for some other imports (especially within agricultural and commodity imports). There is also strong evidence of asymmetry in the adjustment to long-run equilibrium. Deviations from long-run equilibrium due to exchange rate appreciations of the home currency result in a faster adjustment than those caused by a home currency depreciation. Finally, we also find that adjustment takes place in the industries in our sample only when deviations are above certain thresholds, and that these thresholds tend to be somewhat smaller for manufacturing industries than for commodities.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2008/non-linear-adjustment-of-import-prices-in-the-eu.pdf?la=en&hash=60E639BE62EFB001D266DFDDBBE9EF6F56DE85EF", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2008/non-linear-adjustment-of-import-prices-in-the-eu.pdf?la=en&hash=60E639BE62EFB001D266DFDDBBE9EF6F56DE85EF"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2008/non-linear-adjustment-of-import-prices-in-the-eu.pdf?la=en&hash=60E639BE62EFB001D266DFDDBBE9EF6F56DE85EF", "path": "full/ffa6089d36b422b32e3a0e78c0e235fa73d1b083", "checksum": "cd9787beb12a333365c04a2209a821fe", "status": "uptodate"}]},

In this paper we investigate how systemic risk is affected by the structure of the financial system. We construct banking systems that are composed of a number of banks that are connected by interbank linkages. We then vary the key parameters that define the structure of the financial system \u2014 including its level of capitalisation, the degree to which banks are connected, the size of interbank exposures and the degree of concentration of the system \u2014 and analyse the influence of these parameters on the likelihood of contagious (knock-on) defaults. First, we find that the better capitalised banks are, the more resilient is the banking system against contagious defaults and this effect is non-linear. Second, the effect of the degree of connectivity is non-monotonic, that is, initially a small increase in connectivity increases the contagion effect; but after a certain threshold value, connectivity improves the ability of a banking system to absorb shocks. Third, the size of interbank liabilities tends to increase the risk of knock-on default, even if banks hold capital against such exposures. Fourth, more concentrated banking systems are shown to be prone to larger systemic risk, all else equal. In an extension to the main analysis we study how liquidity effects interact with banking structure to produce a greater chance of systemic breakdown. We finally consider how the risk of contagion might depend on the degree of asymmetry (tiering) inherent in the structure of the banking system.

Using Monte Carlo simulations from a purely forward-looking model, this paper shows that indeterminacy can introduce a sizable persistence in the process of inflation.

Moreover, if the debtor is risk-averse, there is an optimal division of bargaining power between the debtor and its creditors.

The data set spans the 1975-2000 period, with wage observations covering approximately 1% of the British workforce. Using this data set, we consider whether wages have become more flexible in recent years. Evidence drawn from macroeconomic wage equation estimates suggests that, while the relationship between wages and unemployment seems to have changed, the responsiveness of wages to unemployment rates has declined in the 1990s. In contrast to previous findings, these results suggest that wages have become less flexible. Micro tests mainly reveal that the prevalence of nominal rigidities has not declined, although there is weak evidence for a decline in the most recent years. Micro tests of wage rigidities also include an analysis of real wage rigidities. There is evidence in the NES of spikes in the wage-change distribution at the rate of inflation, beyond what would be anticipated from the rest of the distribution, suggesting the presence of real wage rigidities.

Increasing firing costs decreases the volatility of output, employment and job flows, due to the reduction of the mass of jobs sensitive to disturbances and lower incentives for firms to hire and fire workers.

This paper suggests that the United Kingdom, United States and other countries may have escaped from a volatile inflation equilibrium. Our argument builds on the story proposed by Tom Sargent in The conquest of American inflation, where the fall in inflation in the 1980s was attributed to the changing beliefs informing monetary policy. To explain the escape in inflation volatility, we unwind one of Sargent's simplifications and allow the monetary authority to react to some of the shocks in the economy. In this new model, a revised account of recent history is that when the evidence turned against the existence of a long-run inflation-output trade-off in the 1980s there was an escape from high inflation, but the authorities were also persuaded to stop using changes in inflation to offset shocks. Inflation and inflation volatility therefore escaped in tandem. Our analysis also sheds some light on why the escape in inflation occurred at the time it did. Our model, like the Sargent model it derives from, omits the revolution in institutional design and understanding that underpins monetary policy. So the gloomy predictions for the future derived from a literal reading of it are likely to be unfounded.\u00a0", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2007/escaping-nash-and-volatile-inflation.pdf?la=en&hash=C1CD521E00CEDABBE190757B6DC209224FF4320B", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2007/escaping-nash-and-volatile-inflation.pdf?la=en&hash=C1CD521E00CEDABBE190757B6DC209224FF4320B"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2007/escaping-nash-and-volatile-inflation.pdf?la=en&hash=C1CD521E00CEDABBE190757B6DC209224FF4320B", "path": "full/b5720e31237321e0fdc630f06d139c1348a61b5b", "checksum": "36f2da3fb24fdc5f30f6505f6a294f6b", "status": "uptodate"}]},

This happens because, without nominal exchange rate flexibility, Asian firms react to the shocks originating in the United States by implementing significant price adjustments, which in turn affect Europe's relative competitive position. On the theoretical side, our results contribute to the literature by suggesting that the shock insulation property of floating exchange rates extends beyond the two countries that have currencies that are free to move. The transmission of shocks between two countries can also be dampened by the choice of floating exchange rates in a third country. On the practical side, we can extend our results to China, the largest Asian economy. If China did eventually decide to float her currency, Europe's exposure to US shocks would decrease.

We find that the long end of the yield curve is primarily driven by changes in the unobserved inflation target. At shorter maturities, yield curve movements reflect short-run inflation and the Taylor rule residual. For holding periods of one month, our preferred model implies that agents require compensation for risks associated with cyclical and inflation shocks but do not require compensation for shocks to the inflation target. For holding periods beyond one month, agents require compensation for all three sources of risks. Time series of risk premia on long forward rates from the preferred yield curve model have declined since the 1970s, which is consistent with perceptions of declining macroeconomic uncertainty or perhaps more efficient macroeconomic stabilisation policies.

Crucially, policy announcements act not just as an instrument but also as a beacon that can potentially communicate information to agents about the policymakers\u2019 reactions to shocks. When the objectives of policymakers are not made transparent, agents are more likely to interpret any accommodation to price shocks as indicating that policymakers are following their own unobserved suboptimal objectives. Policymakers in these regimes are therefore less inclined to be transparent in their explanations. Conversely when policy objectives are more clearly defined, policymakers become more transparent in their explanations too. Then, the less markets will be surprised by interest rate announcements. I show that happens at a diminishing rate: as transparency is improved further from already high levels, there is less of a reduction in the variance of market surprises. The reason is that agents know that they can rely more on the monetary policy beacon in very transparent regimes. Hence they become more active in their decision-making and policymakers take that extra sensitivity into account. The model illustrates the gains to having clearly defined policy objectives. It also explains how a continued occurrence of market surprises, after an initial large reduction, could be consistent with the greater transparency and more precisely formed inflation expectations.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2007/a-model-of-market-surprises.pdf?la=en&hash=4348DAD14C652B5C6BC09BA40D1310DDA7CC1480", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2007/a-model-of-market-surprises.pdf?la=en&hash=4348DAD14C652B5C6BC09BA40D1310DDA7CC1480"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2007/a-model-of-market-surprises.pdf?la=en&hash=4348DAD14C652B5C6BC09BA40D1310DDA7CC1480", "path": "full/358acd85aad5099925c88bd6b88f2599c0b98d4f", "checksum": "e8d33d10512a4346f249b27e20dfef8f", "status": "uptodate"}]},

We find that, historically, inflation persistence has been the exception, rather than the rule, with inflation estimated to have been highly persistent only during the period between the floating of the pound, in June 1972, and the introduction of inflation targeting, in October 1992. As a corollary, our results clearly reject Mishkin\u2019s explanation for time variation in the extent of the Fisher effect, favouring instead Barsky\u2019s theory. We document a remarkable stability across regimes in the correlation between inflation and the rates of growth of both narrow and broad monetary aggregates at the very low frequencies, thus countering the Whiteman-McCallum criticism of Lucas. The post-1992 inflation-targeting regime appears to have been characterised, to date, by the most stable macroeconomic environment in recorded UK history, with the volatilities of the business-cycle components of real GDP, national accounts aggregates, and inflation measures having been, post-1992, systematically lower than for any of the pre-1992 monetary regimes/historical periods, often markedly so, as in the case of inflation and real GDP. The Phillips correlation between inflation and unemployment was flattest under the gold standard, steepest between 1972 and 1992. In line with Ball, Mankiw and Romer, evidence points towards a positive correlation between mean inflation and the steepness of the trade-off. We show how Keynes, in his dispute with Dunlop and Tarshis on real wage cyclicality, was entirely right: during the inter-war period, real wages were strikingly countercyclical.

In this paper, we examine the importance of smoothly functioning payment systems to the economy by extending a recently developed theoretical model of banks. In the model the risk of theft implies a cost to using cash. This risk can be avoided by depositing cash in banks and transferring money through an interbank payment system. However, agents are then exposed to the risk that the payment system is unreliable. Agents will use a payment system (rather than cash) to make transactions if the system is sufficiently cheap to use and/or it is sufficiently reliable. We show that the introduction of a payment system that buyers and producers choose to use unambiguously increases social welfare if it expands the number of trades occurring in the economy. This is more likely the more reliable is the payment system. When the introduction of a payment system does not increase the number of trades, social welfare may increase or decrease depending on the trade-off between the risk of using cash and the risk that the payment system is unreliable.

Using a micro-founded New Keynesian monetary policy model for the US economy, we then show that the structural VARs are capable of reproducing the price puzzle from artificial data only when monetary policy is passive and hence multiple equilibria arise.

We use a monetary overlapping generations model to discuss the cause and durability of this macroeconomic change. In that model, agents' decision rules require them to make forecasts of future inflation, which, because of shocks to productivity, is uncertain. Agents make forecasts of inflation using two rules of thumb or 'heuristics'. One is based on lagged inflation, the other on an inflation target announced by the central bank. They switch between those heuristics based on an imperfect assessment of how each has performed in the past. The way the economy propagates productivity shocks into inflation depends on the proportion of agents using each. Movements in that proportion generate fluctuations in small sample measures of economic volatility. We use this simple model of heuristic switching to contrast the performance of monetary policy rules. We find that, relative to the rule that would be optimal under rational expectations, a rule that responds to both productivity shocks and inflation expectations better stabilises the economy but does not prevent agents switching between heuristics. Finally, we study the impact of introducing an explicit inflation target, which can be used by agents as a simple heuristic, into an economy that did not previously have one. Depending on the heuristics agents have access to before the introduction of the target, this can result in reduced inflation volatility.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2006/the-danger-of-inflation-expectations-of-macroeconomic-stability.pdf?la=en&hash=47B45D97D5BE6A51837098A3E29C2307EA140076", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2006/the-danger-of-inflation-expectations-of-macroeconomic-stability.pdf?la=en&hash=47B45D97D5BE6A51837098A3E29C2307EA140076"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2006/the-danger-of-inflation-expectations-of-macroeconomic-stability.pdf?la=en&hash=47B45D97D5BE6A51837098A3E29C2307EA140076", "path": "full/ac44f5c168f821684a688e925b4576c241a90c50", "checksum": "a8abc89a1a536d970d827719ae24f250", "status": "uptodate"}]},

Using survey data, we first describe some stylised developments in this market over our sample period (1996-2001). We find a gradual change in the distribution of market shares over time. This contrasts with a marked dispersion in price, which appears to persist through time. Analysing the evolution of market shares, we address two key questions: (i) are bank market shares responding to price differentials?; (ii) if not, which type of imperfect competition best fits the data?

The paper delivers two main results. First, the aggregate Solow residual underestimates TFP growth throughout the 1990s, since it does not account for falling utilisation rates and high capital adjustment costs. Second, the impact of non-technological factors on the Solow residual is similar in the first and the second half of the 1990s.

If a bank is holding insufficient eligible collateral in a particular country, and therefore cannot obtain credit from the local central bank, it may have to delay payments. This constitutes a liquidity risk to the system. Furthermore, a bank operating in multiple systems may face a mismatch between the location of its collateral holdings and liquidity needs. In this paper, we examine the extent to which the liquidity risk arising from such a mismatch may be mitigated by allowing cross-border use of collateral. We develop a two-country, two-bank model in which risk-neutral banks minimise expected costs with respect to their collateral choice in each country. In our baseline model, in which each bank faces a liquidity need in only one country, we find that liquidity risk is indeed reduced by cross-border use of collateral. This result holds despite the fact that banks may find it optimal to economise on their total holdings of collateral. However, when we extend the model to allow for the possibility that a bank faces liquidity needs in both countries simultaneously, the total quantum of collateral held is important. Indeed, when a bank finds it optimal to reduce its total holdings, there may be an increase in liquidity risk in at least one country when simultaneous liquidity demands are realised.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2006/modelling-the-cross-border-use-of-collateral-in-payment-systems.pdf?la=en&hash=CB0E225936BE5C2B35E2E951D22E49BD68EDDDB3", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2006/modelling-the-cross-border-use-of-collateral-in-payment-systems.pdf?la=en&hash=CB0E225936BE5C2B35E2E951D22E49BD68EDDDB3"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2006/modelling-the-cross-border-use-of-collateral-in-payment-systems.pdf?la=en&hash=CB0E225936BE5C2B35E2E951D22E49BD68EDDDB3", "path": "full/6d6b5e1da43f5eb80341cb7daa88d12b95ffbba9", "checksum": "cf4d0c6138ac737eee5eba0cb7c14aed", "status": "uptodate"}]},

So measuring the extent of risk sharing informs us about how consumption is likely to respond to country or region-specific shocks to income. This paper presents the evidence for consumption risk sharing by UK consumers, both across regions of the United Kingdom (intranationally) and between the United Kingdom and other countries (internationally). The main motivation for collecting this evidence is to establish to what extent UK consumers insure against income risks, and whether they do so to the same extent intranationally and internationally. Such evidence can tell us whether risk sharing functions effectively as an absorber of country or region-specific shocks in the United Kingdom. We find that there is more risk sharing across the UK regions than between the United Kingdom and other OECD countries. To test the robustness of our conclusions, we document the evidence for risk sharing using recent econometric techniques, which allow explicitly for country or region-specific factors impacting on consumption and output, including measurement errors in the data. We find that our results remain robust when we account for the possible impact of measurement error and preference shocks, and are consistent with results reported in the existing literature. Additionally, our paper also makes a separate contribution to the literature by illustrating the role of the choice of deflators in estimating the true extent of risk sharing for the United Kingdom and OECD. In terms of the channels through which risk sharing occurs, we find that the main mechanism of regional risk sharing operates via cross-regional asset holdings.

We estimate an econometric model of the determinants of public debt dynamics on Brazilian data and use this model to simulate the effect of different fiscal policy rules for future paths of debt. We then derive the set of fiscal policy rules which stabilise public debt dynamics. We find that macroeconomic forecast uncertainty and feedback among the endogenous variables (principally from the debt-GDP ratio to interest rates) force the policy rule to be significantly more responsive to changes in public debt.

These enable transactions ranging from retail payments through to business in domestic and international wholesale financial markets. Given this, were any such system to fail, this could affect the whole economy. This threat to financial stability largely explains why central banks seek to ensure - via their 'oversight' role - that financial infrastructures take sufficient measures to mitigate risk. This paper explores the role of governance of infrastructures in the management of systemic risk. We do this by considering the case of a generic infrastructure provider operating under different forms of ownership. We show that, in the presence of consumption externalities, the level of risk mitigation chosen by the infrastructure provider is less than socially optimal. We then show that governance may have a role in adapting a provider's decision-making process to take due account of their risk externalities and, hence, provide a more socially optimal level of risk mitigation. Specifically, we suggest a feasible adaptation could be for infrastructures to appoint external stakeholder representatives to their boards with a specific remit to act in the wider public interest.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2006/financial-infrastructure-and-corporate-governance.pdf?la=en&hash=77A38988F5712FD00F74263E281DDD443FB1E8B8", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2006/financial-infrastructure-and-corporate-governance.pdf?la=en&hash=77A38988F5712FD00F74263E281DDD443FB1E8B8"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2006/financial-infrastructure-and-corporate-governance.pdf?la=en&hash=77A38988F5712FD00F74263E281DDD443FB1E8B8", "path": "full/41ed7fda5f864392899669043714fee190d91a99", "checksum": "e6cef1d91b8fadcf21830f584b4fab5e", "status": "uptodate"}]},

In an environment where cross-sectional heterogeneity is significant the use of aggregate data can be misleading since aggregation may lead to heavily biased ERPT estimates at the economy-wide level. We demonstrate that the aggregation bias caused by this heterogeneity is not negligible for the UK data. Further, we investigate the source of the cross-sectional variation in the estimated industry-specific pass-through rates. For our sample, we find the industry-specific average inflation rates to be significant in explaining this variation. Furthermore, we find evidence for short-run and long-run partial pass-through into food and manufacturing sectors.

This paper uses a standard event-study methodology to determine the reaction of the acquirer's stock price to announcements of acquisitions in emerging financial markets (EFMs). Under the assumption of efficient markets, a positive reaction is interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that expansion into EFMs is value creating. However, in line with the literature on cross-border banking acquisitions in developed countries, announcements are found to be associated with negative abnormal returns for the acquirer, suggesting that potential downsides, such as operational risk, legal and social barriers, and political risk, are judged by markets to outweigh the potential benefits.

In addition, the UK financial sector is significantly exposed to the corporate sectors in the United States, Germany and France. The model assesses the contribution of investment, acquisitions, cash flows and market-to-book values to the determination of debt, and also the tendency of debt to revert to its optimum level. Debt was found to be positively related to the financing needs of the firm, and the optimum level of debt to be negatively related to the market-to-book ratio. This casts some light on the procyclicality of debt. It suggests the growth of debt in a boom is explained by the increase in financing needs; and this more than offsets the fall in the optimum level of debt associated with the rising market-to-book value. In addition, we found that it may be expected that, in a boom, German and US debt will rise above the optimum level by more than in the United Kingdom and France - responding to the higher levels of investment and acquisitions.

This paper examines quarterly microdata from the Survey of Mortgage Lenders to learn about changes in credit conditions from loan to value ratios (LVRs) and loan to income ratios (LIRs) of first-time buyers (classified by region and age). It combines data on the proportions of high LVR and high LIR loans with aggregate information on UK consumer credit and mortgage debt to give ten quarterly series for 1975-2001. These are modelled in a ten-equation system. A comprehensive set of economic and demographic influences on the demand and supply of credit, applying relevant sign restrictions, are controlled for. A single time-varying index of credit conditions captures the common variation in the ten credit indicators which cannot be explained by the economic and demographic controls. The broad coverage of credit market indicators and thorough investigation of economic forces driving the credit market should make the resulting credit conditions index more robust than previous estimates. The index increases in the 1980s, peaking towards the end of the decade. It retraces part of this rise in the early 1990s, before increasing again to levels, for one of the two measures, exceeding the previous peak.

The present study extends previous work by estimating conditional margin coverage using a GARCH (1,1) model, so that variations in coverage can be tracked over a much shorter time frame. The model is applied to estimating non-coverage probabilities for two heavily traded derivatives contracts, the Brent and FTSE 100 futures. To account for the well-documented fat-tailed characteristics of distributions of futures returns, several variants of the GARCH model are estimated. These assume that innovations are distributed according to either normal, Student t, extreme value or historical distributions. Backtesting is used to select the best performing distribution. During the sample period, margins are found to provide a coverage level generally in excess of 99%, over a one-day time horizon. It is noted, however, that the coverage probability implied by the model is likely to fall under more volatile market conditions; under these circumstances central counterparties will reset initial margin more frequently and call for margin intraday.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2006/assessing-central-counterparty-margin-coverage-on-futures-contracts.pdf?la=en&hash=417C2633EBAC22CB592F61B53352AD06D2E215B9", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2006/assessing-central-counterparty-margin-coverage-on-futures-contracts.pdf?la=en&hash=417C2633EBAC22CB592F61B53352AD06D2E215B9"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2006/assessing-central-counterparty-margin-coverage-on-futures-contracts.pdf?la=en&hash=417C2633EBAC22CB592F61B53352AD06D2E215B9", "path": "full/a3900826e99b6a154becadeb0540fb8edd817e30", "checksum": "1d8d61ba461eea85f990577638fbac84", "status": "uptodate"}]},

The main conclusion is that the recent slowdown was caused by a combination of several shocks: a negative aggregate supply and aggregate spending shock, the increase of oil prices in 1999, and restrictive monetary policy in 2000.

One potential reason was that the models they were using were insufficiently disaggregated. In this paper, an empirical model is estimated whose out-of-sample forecasts largely predicted the global investment boom of the late 1990s. The main factor behind the improved model performance is the distinction between investment in ICT assets and investment in other assets, using disaggregated investment data provided by the OECD. In line with previous studies on US and UK investment performance, ICT investment is estimated to be much more responsive to changes in the real user cost of capital. In particular, panel and seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) estimates suggest very strong relative price effects on ICT investment for all G7 countries and Australia.

The international evidence suggests that the mpcw varies considerably across countries, and new estimates are presented, based on structural vector autoregressions (VARs) for eleven OECD countries, which tend to confirm this finding. It is argued that there is little theoretical rationale for a wide cross-country dispersion of the mpcw, and that the cross-country differences in empirical estimates may in fact reflect difficulties in the measurement of wealth across countries and a failure to account for the shocks causing changes in both consumption and wealth. Using a suitable panel technique, it is found that the hypothesis of a common long-run mpcw across countries cannot be rejected consistently, and a plausible estimate is obtained for the cross-section of eleven OECD countries.

After estimating hybrid NKPCs on US and euro-area data using the generalised method of moments and having found that our results are broadly in line with previous findings, we subject our estimated NKPCs to a thorough stability analysis. We find that the estimated coefficients for the United States are stable, whereas those for the euro area are considerably less stable. We then investigate the possible reasons for this instability. One explanation, explored using the Andrews' test, is the presence of structural breaks. Another possibility is the presence of an aggregation bias, which we investigate by estimating NKPCs for the three largest euro-area economies: Germany, France and Italy. At this disaggregated level, the t of the NKPC improves, but the coefficients are still unstable.

In particular, we consider the possible consequences of the important changes in the framework for setting monetary policy in the United Kingdom in recent decades that have coincided with a more stable and low inflation environment. We set a model of households with 'real-world' mortgages in a partial equilibrium overlapping generations framework calibrated to UK data. We find that the welfare gains of the change of regime would have been considerable. However, the baseline calibration of the model implies that the volatility of aggregate consumption growth would actually be higher in the steady state in the more stable environment of the 1990s regime. This is due to greater synchrony in the response of households to shocks, offsetting the smaller magnitude of macroeconomic shocks. This effect is amplified by higher levels of debt in the 1990s. The result that aggregate consumption volatility could be higher in the current regime suggests that the observed fall in aggregate consumption volatility cannot necessarily be attributed to the more stable macroeconomic environment and the role of mortgage debt. If this result applies, this would suggest that the observed fall in volatility may be due either to other factors or may be a transitional phenomenon rather than a feature of the new steady state.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2005/real-world-mortages-consumption-volatility-and-the-low-inflation-environment.pdf?la=en&hash=DD88D216254D45C360AA07898FB6F60EF4F03E6B", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2005/real-world-mortages-consumption-volatility-and-the-low-inflation-environment.pdf?la=en&hash=DD88D216254D45C360AA07898FB6F60EF4F03E6B"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2005/real-world-mortages-consumption-volatility-and-the-low-inflation-environment.pdf?la=en&hash=DD88D216254D45C360AA07898FB6F60EF4F03E6B", "path": "full/12833b8675a9c87ff176351994ef7fa5ec4fd059", "checksum": "61aeed693f6787d7b763b9521abbb044", "status": "uptodate"}]},

The comparison is performed according to two criteria: liquidity needs and speed of settlement. We assume that the existence of a payment is common knowledge but that the specific degree of time-criticality of a payment is the private information of the bank sending the payment. Hybrid payment systems are shown to outperform Real-Time Gross Settlement when payments are offset in the first period and when they are offset in both periods. This suggests that in a hybrid system, the offsetting facility should be in operation all day, or, at the very least, for some time after the system opens in the morning. A system in which the offsetting facility was only switched on late in the day would not necessarily be preferred to Real-Time Gross Settlement.

Other things being equal, the increase in transparency of the new framework will make monetary policy more predictable once the latest macroeconomic data are known. On this view, the market will be less sensitive to interest rate decisions and more sensitive to data releases. Previous research on the subject showed a more muted reaction to macroeconomic releases in the United Kingdom after 1997, and suggested that markets were still learning the rules of the new monetary framework. With two more years of data and a complementary analysis of trading activity, this study finds that macroeconomic announcements continue to move the markets less in the post-independence period, and interest rate changes the same or more. A separate analysis of the surprise announcements and the surprise component of each announcement reveals a similar pattern. Nor is the possibly greater impact of international announcements \u2014 another candidate explanation \u2014 borne out by the data. Finally, the paper finds that the reactions to macroeconomic announcements are in fact stronger in the second half than in the first half of the post-independence period. An increase in transparency is not the only change brought about by operational independence. Among other things, the collective nature of the Monetary Policy Committee and a perceived shift towards a more implicit policy rule since operational independence may have made its decisions harder to anticipate, thus decreasing the response to macroeconomic releases and increasing the reaction to monetary policy decisions.\u00a0", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2005/learning-the-rules-of-the-new-game.pdf?la=en&hash=2448BB94A1F0562BD75663EF7CF4B2C5CE44E483", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2005/learning-the-rules-of-the-new-game.pdf?la=en&hash=2448BB94A1F0562BD75663EF7CF4B2C5CE44E483"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2005/learning-the-rules-of-the-new-game.pdf?la=en&hash=2448BB94A1F0562BD75663EF7CF4B2C5CE44E483", "path": "full/141ef8e2af9c884171e2fcdce75e2e404631ed73", "checksum": "1dc7f211b973c0b99a40d815742296fc", "status": "uptodate"}]},

Three main hypotheses for this co-movement have been proposed in the literature.First, that an increase in house prices raises households\u2019 wealth, particularly for those in a position to trade down the housing ladder, which increases their desired level of expenditure. Second, that house price growth increases the collateral available to homeowners, reducing credit constraints and thereby facilitating higher consumption. And third, that house prices and consumption have tended to be influenced by common factors. This paper finds that the relationship between house prices and consumption is stronger for younger than older households, and that the consumption of homeowners and renters are equally aligned with the house price cycle.

Changes in the age distribution have made a much smaller contribution, adding only 0.11 percentage points to the growth rate. The rise in female participation has had a small negative effect of 0.08 percentage points, as women have had a preference for part-time work, which tends to be paid less per hour than full-time jobs.

Mortgages are the main component of secured borrowing by households and credit cards\u00a0are a key element in unsecured borrowing. Recent data show that both secured and unsecured debt have risen substantially, both absolutely and as a proportion of income since 1997. Unsecured debt has increased more rapidly\u00a0over this period and so has become more important in overall household debt. During this period of rapid debt\u00a0accumulation, the proportion of mortgage loans in arrears has fallen but the value of credit card arrears relative\u00a0to the value of active card balances has risen. The paper explains these differences in the behaviour of arrears by\u00a0reference to the underlying driving forces identified in previous empirical work. In particular the level of\u00a0housing equity appears to be more important in explaining mortgage arrears, and the role of supply factors is\u00a0highlighted for credit card arrears. Although the estimated models confirm that both income and interest repayments\u00a0(and therefore income gearing) are important factors in explaining both forms of arrears, unemployment only plays\u00a0an additional role for mortgage arrears. Joint testing of the two models suggests a role for the ratio of the value\u00a0of the mortgage loan to the value of housing equity for both kinds of arrears, but with opposing effects. In the\u00a0case of mortgage arrears this might reflect the lenders\u2019 perceptions of the quality of the borrower. Credit card\u00a0arrears appear to contain some information about future mortgage arrears although the reverse does not hold.

In this paper, the phrase \u2018labour market tightness\u2019 is interpreted as describing the balance between the demand for, and the supply of, labour. A logical consequence of this approach is that tightness is not a helpful concept in those models of the labour market, such as the standard competitive and the basic matching model, where there are insufficient rigidities to create imbalances between labour demand and supply. It is proposed that changes in the labour share of income are a convenient yardstick for measuring changes in labour market tightness. In response to certain kinds of shock, changes in the labour share will give misleading signals, but this is likely to occur less frequently than with other oft-cited tightness indicators such as the unemployment rate or the employment rate. The paper concludes by considering the links between labour market tightness and inflation. A key lesson from this analysis is that any attempt to infer the relationships between labour market tightness, various market indicators of it, and inflation, requires both a clear definition of tightness and depends on the specific model of the labour market.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2003/what-does-economic-theory-tell-us-about-labour-market-tightness.pdf?la=en&hash=D788E358710A16A56468AFB168561EB60E86B186", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2003/what-does-economic-theory-tell-us-about-labour-market-tightness.pdf?la=en&hash=D788E358710A16A56468AFB168561EB60E86B186"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2003/what-does-economic-theory-tell-us-about-labour-market-tightness.pdf?la=en&hash=D788E358710A16A56468AFB168561EB60E86B186", "path": "full/f1a3c0c9b9878f43c4560d199406677743b99b11", "checksum": "da03fe97d7eeed3d88f8b457bbf3f62c", "status": "uptodate"}]},

From the capital accumulation identity, it also follows that the capital stock and investment have a long-run proportional relationship. The dynamic structure thus implies a multi-cointegrating framework, in which separate cointegrating relationships are identifiable. This has been used to justify the estimation of investment equations embodying a reduced-form long-run relationship between investment and output (rather than between the capital stock and output). In this paper, a new investment equation is estimated in the full structural framework, exploiting a measure of the capital stock constructed by the Bank, and a long series for the cost of capital. A CES production function is assumed, and a well-determined estimate of the elasticity of substitution is obtained by a variety of measures. The robust result is that the elasticity of substitution is significantly different from unity (the Cobb-Douglas case), at about 0.45. Overidentifying restrictions on the long-run relationship are all accepted. Although the key long-run parameter (the elasticity of substitution) is highly robust to alternative specifications, single-equation investment relationships may obscure the dynamics.

Shocks to real interest rates and income growth expectations, combined with demographic changes, are considered to explain the rise in US household debt. The calibrated model is found to be able to explain many features of US household borrowing, both in aggregate and cross-section. In particular, it predicts that the debt to income ratio would have increased substantially during the 1990s and would be expected to continue to grow in coming years. However, the model is unable to account for rising indebtedness during the 1980s when high interest rates, lower income growth and an ageing population would have tended to reduce aggregate borrowing.

By the Granger representation theorem, there must be a (vector) error correction mechanism ((V)ECM) representation of the data; but from the theory, the equilibrating ECM cannot be in consumption. Instead, even with generalisations such as habit persistence, this equilibration should take place via income or wealth. Furthermore, unless the relative price of durables and non-durables is constant, the relative price needs to be taken into account in modelling. In this paper, the short-run dynamics and long-run relationship between non-durable consumption, non-asset income, wealth and the relative price of durable goods are examined. A cointegrating relationship is found to exist. Estimating VECMs, it is found that the adjustment towards the long-run common trend does indeed occur partly via changes in wealth, consistent with forward-looking behaviour on the part of agents. The result implies that consumption will predict asset returns, and this is confirmed by a regression of excess equity returns on the lagged disequilibrium term.

We show that two types of outcome are possible - inefficient or efficient - depending on whether banks care about payments imbalances between them in the first period. If they do, banks delay payments to each other, increasing their aggregate liquidity requirements. We argue that efficiency is not guaranteed even when banks face repeated interaction in a real payment system, largely because of imperfect information and the competitive dynamics of the payment industry. An efficient outcome can be achieved by the imposition of throughput rules on the value of payments banks must make by a certain deadline.

Diversification across various sources of earnings is welcomed for, it is claimed, diversification reduces risk.

The paper finds that rating schemes that are designed to be more stable over the cycle, akin to those of the external rating agencies, would not increase procyclicality, but ratings that are conditioned on the current point in the cycle, akin in some respects to a Merton approach, could substantially increase procyclicality. This makes the question of which rating schemes banks will use very important. The paper uses a general equilibrium model of the financial system to explore whether banks would choose to use a countercyclical, procyclical or neutral rating scheme. The results indicate that banks would not choose a stable rating approach, which has important policy implications for the design of the Accord.

We first focus on the Bank of England\u2019s policy target, the two-week repo rate. Our tests indicate that tighter spreads between the two-week market rate and the official repo rate result in lower money market volatility at the very short end of the money market curve. The effects at the longer end are much weaker. But we find no evidence of transmission of two-week volatility along the money market curve. In contrast to many other central banks, the Bank of England does not employ an operating target for the overnight rate. We find no evidence that allowing greater variation in overnight rates undermines efforts of the central bank to keep other money market rates in alignment with the rate at which it operates when implementing its monetary policy. Our results further indicate that volatility of rates at the very short end of the UK money market yield curve has declined significantly since the early 1990s. The introduction of the gilt repo market in January 1996 was associated with lower money market volatility, although we have evidence that volatility had started to fall as early as mid-1995. The effects of the 1997 reforms of the Bank of England\u2019s open market operations are less discernible in the data.

First, the failure of the aggregate equations is explained more formally in terms of misspecification when relative prices are trending downwards. Second, the econometric analysis is conducted in a formal cointegration framework.

The model is a simplified version of the real world consisting of a non-bank private sector, banks, a central bank, a government and a regulator. The model is used to analyse actions by policy-makers and to identify policy relevant empirical work. Key analytical results are: a financially fragile system need not collapse; efficiency can be improved with policy intervention; and a system with heterogeneous banks is more stable than one with homogeneous ones. Existence of monetary equilibria allows for positive default levels in equilibrium. It also characterises contagion and financial fragility as an equilibrium phenomenon. A definition of financial fragility is proposed. Financial fragility occurs when aggregate profitability of the banking sector declines and defaults in the non-bank and banking private sectors increase. Thus, equilibria with financial fragility require financial vulnerability in the banking sector and liquidity shortages in the non-bank private sector. The model will be used as a basis to carry out empirical work on the costs of financial instability, to quantify the effectiveness of particular regulatory tools such as capital requirements, and to identify trade-offs between increasing stability through action by authorities and the efficiency of the financial system.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2003/equilibrium-analysis-banking-contagion-and-financial-fragility.pdf?la=en&hash=7EA94EDAD7891A9FA2EED1EE8ECF089CFF0E698B", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2003/equilibrium-analysis-banking-contagion-and-financial-fragility.pdf?la=en&hash=7EA94EDAD7891A9FA2EED1EE8ECF089CFF0E698B"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2003/equilibrium-analysis-banking-contagion-and-financial-fragility.pdf?la=en&hash=7EA94EDAD7891A9FA2EED1EE8ECF089CFF0E698B", "path": "full/0bb4759090d719da64739ab3712eb27598d39bc7", "checksum": "b6b9db05df299541418ed0f44821e55b", "status": "uptodate"}]},

The panel is estimated using the pooled mean group technique due to Pesaran, Shin and Smith (1999). This is essentially a dynamic error correction model where cross-sectional coefficients are allowed to vary in the short run but are required to be homogeneous in the long run. This allows a separation of short-run dynamics and adjustment towards the equilibrium. The model is used to benchmark market spreads and assess whether sovereign risk was \u2018overpriced\u2019 or \u2018underpriced\u2019 during different periods over the past decade. The results suggest that a debtor country\u2019s fundamentals and external liquidity conditions are important determinants of market spreads. However, the diagnostic statistics also indicate that the market assessment of a country\u2019s creditworthiness is more broad based than that provided by the set of fundamentals included in the model.

There is little previous empirical literature. But where there is, models have either studied particular markets or have developed single-equation approaches. Lack of suitable data has been a major impediment. In this paper a model of the real estate sector is constructed using econometric analysis of rental values and bank lending, supplemented by a calibrated model of the remainder of the financial accounts of real estate companies (using data for private and public real estate companies). Using related work on company-failure models, it is possible to extend the analysis to provide an equation for the probability of default of real estate companies. The empirical results fail to find a role for borrowing costs in the bank lending equation before 1999, but unless borrowing costs are included after this period, the equation breaks down and systematically underestimates the growth in lending to real estate from then on. Various potential explanations are examined for this breakdown, including the importance of sale and lease-backs. The estimated rental equation appears more stable. The historical tracking performance of the estimated real estate model fails to capture the full extent of the swings in capital values and bank lending in the early 1990s. This is attributed to shifts in the discount rate applied to property income, possibly reflecting a temporary shift in risk premia during this period. The property sector links to the rest of the private non-financial corporate sector through its role as collateral.

Standard specifications of traditional Phillips curves have tended to overpredict inflation in the recent low inflation, low unemployment era in the United States, the United Kingdom and the euro area. This has stimulated the \u2018New Phillips Curve\u2019 approach, which has had success for the United States and the euro area, both less open economies than the United Kingdom. The paper is divided into two parts. First, the overprediction problem is documented for the United Kingdom, and an attempt is made to solve it in a traditional Phillips curve framework by introducing external shocks (terms of trade shocks or domestically generated inflation). This does not fully solve the problem. It is argued that there is a further misspecification problem with traditional Phillips curve estimates, due to the presence of the regime changes and structural change in the UK economy. Second, \u2018New Phillips Curve\u2019 estimates are examined. They perform badly; real marginal cost is not significant in the baseline specification. The relationship between marginal cost and inflation disappears in the mid-1980s. When a labour share measure is used, real marginal cost becomes significant, but goodness of fit based on fundamental inflation remains poor. The \u2018New Phillips Curve\u2019 model is then extended to allow for open economy influences, taking into account imported intermediate goods. This is found to mitigate substantially the breakdown of the relationship between inflation and marginal cost. Fit improves, but a tendency to underpredict and then overpredict inflation remains. Finally, the open-economy measure of marginal cost is decomposed. The wage mark-up component is important and highly countercyclical. Relative price movements, of taxes relative to overall prices and of imported intermediate goods relative to wages, are found to have been a negative influence on marginal costs over the 1990s. Understanding likely future developments in these relative prices could contribute to the assessment of prospects for marginal costs and the pressures on inflation.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2002/understanding-uk-inflation.pdf?la=en&hash=4CBA95D6EBE8961A2B71B3E7C5D0F32849AF6262", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2002/understanding-uk-inflation.pdf?la=en&hash=4CBA95D6EBE8961A2B71B3E7C5D0F32849AF6262"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2002/understanding-uk-inflation.pdf?la=en&hash=4CBA95D6EBE8961A2B71B3E7C5D0F32849AF6262", "path": "full/a884e6b51cf6e6ac662a3a557c4a61378064f72b", "checksum": "22c3185400cd260199b4351bd11640e4", "status": "uptodate"}]},

We embed these scenarios in the macroeconomic BGG model and investigate how they affect dynamic responses of the real economy to monetary and real shocks. Our simulations show that in the context of the BGG model, the balance sheet positions of the financial and non-financial corporate sectors can affect the monetary transmission mechanism. We illustrate that in certain financial scenarios in the model the financial accelerator mechanism is very potent, whereas in others it has little incremental impact. This implies that, for a given shock, monetary policy can be less or more proactive, respectively. In addition, the model simulation results suggest that certain parameters may merit particular attention.

While there are clear risks to this aggregate outlook, these would be present even without demographic change. The paper also discusses the risks to the living standards of individuals and individual cohorts. These risks have changed in three main ways as a result of demographic change. First, ageing has been a factor throughout the world in encouraging a shift from public to private provision for old age, increasing the proportion of retired people exposed to risks to market prices and rates of return. Second, the size of the group exposed to such risks is growing larger as a direct result of ageing. Third, any adverse effects of demographic change are most likely to be felt in old age; one of the effects of people living longer is that they have to spread their lifetime incomes over more years of life, implying a need for more saving when working.

This article sheds light on the solvency standards implied by current and possible future G10 bank regulation and on the \u2018economic solvency standard\u2019 that banks choose themselves by their own capital-setting decisions. In particular, we employ a credit risk model to show that the survival probability implied by the 1988 Basel Accord is between 99.0% and 99.9%. We then demonstrate that if a new Basel Accord were calibrated to such a standard, it would not represent a binding constraint on banks\u2019 current operations since most banks employ a solvency standard significantly higher than 99.9%. To show this, we employ a statistical analysis of bank ratings adjusted for the impact of official or other support as well as credit risk model calculations.

The argument is illustrated by the experience of the United States in the 1990s. Here net investment increased more rapidly than gross investment and both grew faster than GDP, while the aggregate depreciation rate rose. Nevertheless the aggregate capital stock grew more slowly than GDP, and depreciation as a proportion of GDP was flat. Both official NDP and WNDP have been growing a little more slowly than GDP.

On the other hand, its main open-economy alternative, ie Ball\u2019s (1999) rule based on a monetary conditions index (MCI), may perform poorly in the face of specific types of exchange rate shocks and thus cannot offer guidance for the day-to-day conduct of monetary policy. In this paper we specify and evaluate a comprehensive set of simple monetary policy rules that are suitable for small open economies in general, and for the United Kingdom in particular. We do so by examining the performance of a battery of simple rules, including the familiar Taylor rule and MCI-based rules \u00e0 la Ball. This entails comparing the asymptotic properties of a two-sector open-economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model calibrated on UK data under different rules. We find that an inflation-forecast-based rule (IFB), ie a rule that reacts to deviations of expected inflation from target, is a good simple rule in this respect. Adding a separate response to the level of the real exchange rate (contemporaneous and lagged) appears to reduce the difference in adjustment between output gaps in the two sectors of the economy, but the improvement is only marginal.

We find that our estimate of capital utilisation tracks survey-based measures quite closely, while movements in total hours worked drive our labour effort series.

Nevertheless, a weighted average of capital utilisation and labour effort \u2013 aggregate factor utilisation \u2013 is not closely related to the detrended Solow residual. This suggests that measures that conflate capacity utilisation and temporary deviations in TFP from its steady-state growth rate may be misleading indicators of excess demand pressure.

We use the theoretical framework developed by Layard, Nickell and Jackman (LNJ) to explain changes in the equilibrium unemployment rate. In the LNJ framework, equilibrium unemployment is determined by the interaction of the price and wage-setting behaviour of firms and workers. The natural rate is a function of structural variables such as the replacement ratio and union power that affect the size of firms\u2019 and workers\u2019 mark-ups. Examining a wide range of equations with different combinations of structural variables, we find it extremely difficult to derive robust coefficient estimates that are statistically significant and have the expected signs on structural variables, unless a trended variable such as the owner-occupied housing rate is included. However, it is likely that these variables are simply capturing the upward trend in actual unemployment over most of the sample period in response to exogenous shocks. We find these results to be robust over different sample periods and different equation specifications.

The tests are conducted on a panel of 18 OECD economies using the United States as a numeraire for the post-Bretton Woods era. The results are obtained using new non-stationary panel estimation techniques, which significantly increase the power of the tests. All the tests suggest that there is little evidence supporting PPP when it is tested directly. This contrasts with earlier panel data studies, which tended to find that the real exchange rate was stationary. The results supporting a long-run relationship between real exchange rates and real interest rate differentials appear to be more positive. This again provides a contrast with earlier results, which tended to find no evidence of cointegration. Such studies concentrated on G7 economies. To investigate this further we split the panel into two groups: the G7 and eleven small open economies. For the panel of small open economies we find strong evidence in favour of cointegration.

The competitive forces that act to compete away abnormal returns need not act symmetrically and may differ at different points in the distribution of profitability. This suggestion is tested empirically on an unbalanced panel of 2,129 companies. First, evidence for both asymmetries and non-linearities in the persistence of company profitability is found. The results are consistent with the notion that competitive forces act less swiftly to eliminate superior returns than inferior returns and/or that companies attempt to allocate a positive result to more years than they would allocate a poor result. Second, by imposing a linear specification, previous studies are likely to have understated the extent of persistence of superior profitability.

A greater degree of variation between industries is found when allowing for persistence in a non-linear fashion.

Technological change in the ICT sector leads to a fall in the relative price of ICT goods, which leads firms to invest more heavily in high-tech goods. The approach is to build a dynamic general equilibrium model that is consistent with key stylised facts of the UK economy. We use that model to quantify the contribution to long-run growth of technological progress that is specific to the ICT sector. We find that technological progress that is specific to the ICT sector might account for around 20%-30% of long-run labour productivity growth, if this progress continues at the rate observed over the past 25 years. But this conclusion depends crucially on how ICT prices are measured and in particular on the estimate of the long-run rate of decline of ICT prices. We show that shocks to technological progress that is specific to production of ICT investment goods can have very different macroeconomic implications from a shock that applies to production of all goods. We demonstrate that a permanent increase in the growth rate of ICT-specific technological progress will increase the investment expenditure share of GDP but lower the aggregate depreciation rate, while an increase in the return to investment in ICT will increase both the expenditure share and the depreciation rate.\u00a0", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2001/investment-specific-technological-progress-in-the-uk.pdf?la=en&hash=11058532222704EAB836BF3AEFDFC3B47BBB7B39", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2001/investment-specific-technological-progress-in-the-uk.pdf?la=en&hash=11058532222704EAB836BF3AEFDFC3B47BBB7B39"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2001/investment-specific-technological-progress-in-the-uk.pdf?la=en&hash=11058532222704EAB836BF3AEFDFC3B47BBB7B39", "path": "full/8d7abda8101609b8791c43f372c302e9eb59a073", "checksum": "eb70dcac68e96b7ddca0472384290ee0", "status": "uptodate"}]},

The birth rate of new companies, an index of property prices and nominal interest rates have significant short-term effects. The estimated equation is robust to changes in the sample period.

In this paper we investigate the properties of monetary regimes that combine price level and inflation targeting. We offer two characterisations of these regimes: a set of optimal control rules obtained assuming that policy-makers minimise a loss function that penalises a mixed price level/inflation target; and a set of simple rules feeding back from alternative combinations of (current and future-dated) price level and inflation deviations from target. We derive asymptotic variances of the price level, inflation and output associated with each of these regimes when the economy is modelled as a small-scale open-economy RE model calibrated on UK data. We conclude that: (i) the relative merits of price level and inflation targeting, as well as of mixes of these two, are a function of several modelling and policy assumptions; and (ii) these merits do not change monotonically as we move from one regime to another.

First, it is shown that: (a) depending on the stochastic properties of the filtered process, the band-pass filtered cyclical component is entirely authentic, partly or mostly spurious, or even entirely spurious; and (b) as a simple consequence of the Lucas critique, the degree of authenticity of band-pass filtered cyclical components crucially depends on the monetary rule followed by the policy-maker. Second, taking a number of macroeconomic models as data-generation processes it is shown that band-pass filtering: (a) may markedly distort key business cycle stylised facts, as captured by the cross-correlations and the cross-spectral statistics between the cyclical components of the variables of interest and the cyclical component of GDP; and (b) may well create entirely spurious stylised facts. For example: both productivity and the money supply may appear procyclical even when they follow random walks by construction; the real wage may appear procyclical when in fact it is countercyclical; in general, the Phillips correlation between inflation and the cyclical component of economic activity will appear weaker than it is in reality. Again, the degree of authenticity of business cycle stylised facts uncovered via band-pass filtering crucially depends on the monetary rule followed by the policy-maker.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2001/band-pass-filtering-cointegration-and-business-cycle-analysis.pdf?la=en&hash=38FD943458890DC9855A9AB9EC1141C613E2594C", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2001/band-pass-filtering-cointegration-and-business-cycle-analysis.pdf?la=en&hash=38FD943458890DC9855A9AB9EC1141C613E2594C"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2001/band-pass-filtering-cointegration-and-business-cycle-analysis.pdf?la=en&hash=38FD943458890DC9855A9AB9EC1141C613E2594C", "path": "full/f02b4340c7e9230965ebd8e1850f0732ee7bbdf4", "checksum": "7c8c6678fd60667b0670f1da77c71335", "status": "uptodate"}]},

I am chiefly concerned with the flexibility to make wage and employment adjustments at the microeconomic (firm or plant) level. The two models I examine are an \u2018equilibrium business cycle\u2019 model of the labour market and a \u2018search\u2019 model. They predict that an increase in labour market flexibility will lead to an increase in output and consumption and a fall in unemployment and hours. They also predict that employment and unemployment will become less volatile. Since about 1985, the level and persistence of the unemployment rate have fallen, as predicted by the theory. But this has been accompanied by a fall in unemployment incidence and not much change in duration: the reverse of what we would have expected, given the theory. Average hours worked have fallen, as predicted by the theory. In terms of cyclical behaviour, we can note that the volatilities of output, consumption, employment and unemployment have all increased in the most recent cycle, though the volatility of hours worked relative to output has fallen, as suggested by the models. Finally, a graph of trend (HP-filtered) output and consumption reveals a \u2018step jump\u2019, which we could take as some evidence for the models (though we could imagine other plausible explanations for such a change).", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2000/the-effects-of-increased-labour-market-flexibility-in-the-uk-theory-and-practice.pdf?la=en&hash=DBAAAD37587BCC7A3638805ABC0AD10797A24794", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2000/the-effects-of-increased-labour-market-flexibility-in-the-uk-theory-and-practice.pdf?la=en&hash=DBAAAD37587BCC7A3638805ABC0AD10797A24794"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2000/the-effects-of-increased-labour-market-flexibility-in-the-uk-theory-and-practice.pdf?la=en&hash=DBAAAD37587BCC7A3638805ABC0AD10797A24794", "path": "full/6241d6ae7a711a2e38d6451608174c03c599edfa", "checksum": "db9aed83ee23764c0f120e58188538d5", "status": "uptodate"}]},

This paper begins to address these questions by examining the absolute and relative robustness of two of the most common methods for estimating implied PDFs \u2014 the double-lognormal approximating function and the smoothed implied volatility smile methods. The changes resulting from randomly perturbing quoted prices by no more than a half tick provide a lower bound on the confidence intervals of the summary statistics derived from the estimated PDFs. Tests are conducted using options contracts tied to short sterling futures and the FTSE 100 index \u2014 both trading on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange.

This is consistent with \u2014 and illustrates one of the tangible benefits of \u2014 the increased transparency of the United Kingdom\u2019s monetary policy framework under inflation targeting.", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2000/monetary-policy-surprises-and-the-yield-curve.pdf?la=en&hash=89C4BAD98E710952503DD40DBA15B2CEAB3681C4", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2000/monetary-policy-surprises-and-the-yield-curve.pdf?la=en&hash=89C4BAD98E710952503DD40DBA15B2CEAB3681C4"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2000/monetary-policy-surprises-and-the-yield-curve.pdf?la=en&hash=89C4BAD98E710952503DD40DBA15B2CEAB3681C4", "path": "full/af732178fc10ac0f430930a5421bb03c6815669e", "checksum": "774182edd022eede18ceabc7d06e5528", "status": "uptodate"}]},

A necessary condition for this is that the short nominal interest rate is constrained by its lower bound, typically zero. The paper develops a small analytical model to show how an economy can get into a liquidity trap, how it can avoid getting into one and how it can get out. We also consider the empirical likelihood of the UK economy hitting the zero nominal rate bound, by investigating the relationship between the level of the short nominal interest rate and its volatility. The empirical evidence on this issue is mixed. To reduce the risk of falling into a liquidity trap, the authorities have two options. The first is to raise the inflation target. The second is to lower the zero nominal interest rate floor. This second option involves paying negative interest on government \u2018bearer bonds\u2019 - coin and currency - ie \u2018taxing money\u2019, as advocated by Gesell. Once in a liquidity trap, there are two means of escape. The first is to use expansionary fiscal policy. The second is, again, to lower the zero nominal interest rate floor.

We find that markets are efficient, in the sense that asset prices do not respond to the expected component of RPI announcements. Generally, only government bond prices appear sensitive to inflation news, and we find that this sensitivity was particularly marked after late 1992, when the UK adopted an explicit inflation target. The responsiveness of implied medium and long-term forward inflation rates (calculated from conventional and index-linked bonds) during the post-1992 period is consistent with the expected inflation hypothesis, a result that suggests that the pre-independence inflation-targeting framework was not seen as fully credible by the financial markets.

The reason is that, although both approaches can get rid of the inflationary bias, the impact of uncertain preferences on the variance of inflation will be considerably higher with an inflation target.\u00a0Contrary to Beetsma and Jensen (1998) we find that the optimal inflation target depends on the degree of preference uncertainty.

We find that IS shocks underlay the majority of the variance of sterling real and nominal exchange rates. Aggregate supply (AS) shocks were the second most important source of such variations, while LM shocks played an extremely limited role. In contrast, the variance of UK relative consumer prices was primarily attributed to LM shocks. Combining those results with the estimated impulse response functions indicates that the sterling exchange rate depreciations over the floating rate period were largely associated with falls in UK relative consumer prices. But it would be inappropriate for policy-makers to base any future policy response to sterling fluctuations on that finding because: (a) the Lucas\u00a0critique applies to it; and (b) it represents the average dynamic interaction over the sample period. We also find that: (i) the estimated impulse responses following each of the shocks are highly theory-consistent; and (ii) the periods in which the SVARs suggest that particular shocks were especially important can be linked to observed macroeconomic developments.

There is substantial heterogeneity (both across sectors and time) in rates of growth of value added, hours worked, labour productivity and Total Factor Productivity during the sample period. The decline in constant price value-added in aggregate manufacturing during the sample period is associated with signi cant changes in the relative size of individual sectors, and with noticeable changes in performance between the two peak-to-peak business cycles 1973-79 and 1979-89. Despite changes in the relative size of sectors, the vast majority of aggregate productivity growth is explained by within-sector productivity growth. An analysis of productivity levels also reveals considerable heterogeneity. The distribution of productivity levels across sectors exhibits an increase in dispersion and becomes increasingly positively skewed during the sample period.

Using an extended stochastic growth model we construct estimates of productivity and preference shocks both of which are highly persistent, volatile and potentially capable of explaining UK business cycles. We find the productivity term is the dominant explanation of UK output fluctuations but our estimated preference shift is crucial in understanding employment movements. We use a variety of Granger causality tests to establish whether these productivity and preference terms are predictable and so can be potentially considered as the cause of UK business cycles or whether they are themselves Granger caused by other variables. We find our estimated productivity term is not predicted by any demand-side variable, including various fiscal and monetary policy instruments, but is to a limited extent by oil prices and the share of taxes in GDP. This suggests that our \u2018productivity\u2019 shock may also reflect other supply-side influences.

In particular it examines how they behave over the business cycle. It has two main findings. First, the estimated average mark-ups and the profit margin results both suggest that there is imperfect competition in manufacturing and services. Second, mark-ups are pro-cyclical, as are profit margins even after allowing for movements in their standard determinants. This suggests that price pressures may increase during recovery periods and decrease during recessions. One possible explanation for this is Kreps and Scheinkman\u2019s argument that the pro-cyclicality of capacity constraints means that firms move between Cournot and Bertrand competition over the cycle.

The survey sheds light not only on the extent of price rigidity in general, but also on the form this rigidity takes, and the characteristics of companies and markets that influence it. The survey found that, although market conditions are of primary importance in price determination, many companies set prices on the basis of cost plus a mark up. There was also evidence of considerable price rigidity. In the year preceding the survey, the average company reviewed its prices once a month. Time-dependent pricing rules appeared to be much more widespread than state-dependent pricing rules, suggesting that the short-run real effects of monetary policy could increase at lower rates of inflation. Retailers reviewed and changed their prices more frequently than manufacturers. As in Carlton (1986), companies operating in more competitive markets reviewed prices more often than companies with few direct competitors; but in contrast to his findings long-term relationships with customers appeared to reduce price flexibility. Despite the frequency of reviews, actual prices were only changed twice on average, indicating that there may be substantial costs of changing prices. Companies stated that the physical menu costs of changing prices were a less important source of price rigidity than the need to preserve customer relationships (due to explicit or implicit contractual arrangements) or to\u00a0maintain market share. In addition, cost-based rather than market-led pricing was widespread and the overwhelming majority of companies indicated that they would be more likely to increase overtime and capacity than change their price in response to a boom in demand. The survey also found substantial asymmetries in the factors which drive prices up and those that push prices down. Overall, the survey results indicate that UK markets do not behave as if prices are costlessly and instantaneously determined.

A\u00a0standard analytical framework is presented which illustrates the importance of the\u00a0components of the real interest differential - namely capital controls, risk premia and\u00a0the real exchange rate - as endogenous mechanisms for the transmission of policy.\u00a0As such, variations in the real interest differential are shown potentially to be\u00a0important for ensuring dynamic convergence to a steady-state EMU.\u00a0", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/1992/real-interest-parity-dynamic-convergence-and-the-european-monetary-system.pdf?la=en&hash=F4164915476A18BE50BC60E81D52D297932C4327", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/1992/real-interest-parity-dynamic-convergence-and-the-european-monetary-system.pdf?la=en&hash=F4164915476A18BE50BC60E81D52D297932C4327"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/1992/real-interest-parity-dynamic-convergence-and-the-european-monetary-system.pdf?la=en&hash=F4164915476A18BE50BC60E81D52D297932C4327", "path": "full/fa08c89ca3662c3ffe3573b6707378c0abeacc2d", "checksum": "b3c61b318146c5a776da69bccd2beaeb", "status": "uptodate"}]},

Related issues concerning externalities from banking activity, which entail a deviation of private from social\u00a0measures of banking output, are outlined. For output, the national accounts, production and intermediation approaches are compared. As regards productivity,\u00a0both partial and total factor productivity measures, and the DEA and parametric approaches to the latter are assessed. The externalities from banking are shown to\u00a0include contributions to economic development, external economies of scale between\u00a0institutions, and contagious effects of failures. Among the most striking results is the\u00a0prevalence of technical inefficiency in banking. In addition, externality issues are\u00a0rarely considered in combination nor assessed empirically. But more generally, it is\u00a0also suggested that measurement techniques have often outpaced the theory of what is\u00a0to be measured, notably in fields such as joint production, risk and competition.\u00a0Alternative approaches to address these issues are suggested.\u00a0", "pdf_url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/1992/output-productivity-and-externalities-the-case-of-banking.pdf?la=en&hash=B74CB81C79B487AAEF8EECEFE47D1E105C6787AD", "file_urls": ["https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/1992/output-productivity-and-externalities-the-case-of-banking.pdf?la=en&hash=B74CB81C79B487AAEF8EECEFE47D1E105C6787AD"], "files": [{"url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/1992/output-productivity-and-externalities-the-case-of-banking.pdf?la=en&hash=B74CB81C79B487AAEF8EECEFE47D1E105C6787AD", "path": "full/9c025c0444d6ee064f35f7e59f93d66b47488a9a", "checksum": "c78194edc1957c1215a396a28140ef35", "status": "uptodate"}]}
